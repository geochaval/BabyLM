Larna: 'Oh yeah, yeah'

Pauline: 'and he's sending it first post, it should be through today, if not tomorrow morning, erm'

Larna: 'Oh dear'

Pauline: 'the other one gave us a quote for three hundred and eighty eight'

Larna: 'Oh that's not bad then'

Pauline: 'which was good, but Gary's suspicious at that price'

Larna: 'Three hundred and eighty eight?'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'What's that to do?'

Pauline: 'comparing it, comparing it with erm one thousand, two hundred, he's, he says it's rather suspicious'

Larna: 'What is that for the actual three hund'

Pauline: 'Just, just the actual erm sliding mirror wardrobes'

Larna: 'Just the doors no fitting or anything?'

Pauline: 'Yeah it's for the fittings and everything, erm and I've had prices like one thousand two hundred, eighteen hundred, and this bloke you know, says three hundred and eighty eight'

Larna: 'Oh'

Pauline: 'and Gary's rather suspicious at that price, we, we had a builder that came round he, he wanted four hundred and twenty'

Larna: 'Yes'

Pauline: 'and that was with the doors from Texas and he thought oh no you know'

Larna: 'Yeah'

Pauline: 'we'd rather get it done properly, erm, but erm, this [UNK] that came yesterday morning, he reckons it, that he can do the whole of the bedroom, look there's been an accident, I've got to tell you'

Larna: 'Oh good'

Pauline: 'they've gone right over that bank, right over that bank, right over there, it's bounced over'

Larna: 'It's speeding I expect'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'to get that far'

Pauline: 'erm and they can do the wardrobes and the fitment erm and wardrobes either side erm for eighteen hundred'

Larna: 'Oh'

Pauline: 'which is the price we were looking at, it's not too cheap and it's not too expensive'

Larna: 'Yeah'

Pauline: 'cos Gary sort of said we should set prices that are too low'

Larna: 'Maybe they just, he just done it so cheap because of the recession I mean'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'you can get almost anything done at the moment'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'can't you?'

Pauline: 'so we'll wait and see'

Larna: 'Well was it all private people then'

Pauline: 'we'll see what price they give'

Larna: 'or companies?'

Pauline: 'No it's all companies'

Larna: 'What even this three hundred and eighty eight?'

Pauline: 'Yeah, that's [UNK]'

Larna: 'Well you can always check it out'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'make sure it is a genuine it, the, the, he's come from the company and he's not doing it privately or something'

Pauline: 'You see the thing is, I said, Gary said to me he said did you ask them about the over bed erm units and that and I said yeah, I said he wanted to, he, he said he could do the over bed unit for eighteen hundred plus the wardrobes for three eighty eight'

Larna: 'Yeah'

Pauline: 'well this [UNK] people I mean with, with, that I mean that really is more or less the same amount as the other companies have said for er more or less the whole lot, so why the wardrobes are so cheap and yet the, the bed surrounding is so expensive, we don't know'

Larna: 'Mm'

Pauline: 'whereas [UNK] people they reckon that they can do it, they can do the whole lot for eighteen hundred'

Larna: 'Yeah, oh strange isn't it?'

Pauline: 'Yeah, it's er, it's er cheap for the wardrobes, but expensive for the over bed unit, I mean Gary said well at that price he said the over bed unit we might as well get out of a catalogue.'

Larna: 'Well, yeah, talking of catalogues actually you might know, my two want a beanbag right?'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'They've got one in Argos but the colours are disgusting and it's twenty pound, you see I went and brought one for Boo Boo, that one from Argos'

Pauline: 'Yeah, yeah I think they want twelve, twelve ninety nine or something off the market'

Pauline: 'Twenty five past nine'

Larna: 'I normally, let, well, if I put an hour and a half in cos if we're a bit late'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'five or ten minutes late, it's cheaper for me to put ten P in than to pay twelve pound ticket'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'actually it's twenty pound'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'right, I'll just nip over and get it, cos I haven't locked up yet maybe I won't I haven't got ten P, I've only got two pennies, just have to make sure back'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'and they'd both been there thirty years since they've left school'

Larna: 'and they said that some of them were thinking of moving, but'

Pauline: 'and they also reckon that the Gosport and Portsmouth are the worst off than anywhere else in this country'

Larna: 'Yeah it's very sad, but, what can you do?
That's why Alex has had to go back to London'

Larna: 'Why's that?'

Pauline: 'They don't get paid that much'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'I mean years ago I can remember coming into town and seeing that furniture shop filled with people walking around, every time I go past it now it is empty'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'which is why I think a lot of things, places should be able to accommodate for shop owners and reduce their leases while this recession's on'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'It's so unfair'

Larna: 'I won't half be surprised if they get in this time, I really will'

Pauline: 'The trouble is, us council owners will be worse off under the Labour council'

Larna: 'Oh what they didn't ban it?'

Pauline: 'Mm, yeah'

Larna: 'I'll go in these doors, I wasn't surprised, I didn't think they would, but as this guy said afterwards he said whether you do it now or later he said, within the next five years it's gonna be banned so I think it still will be banned in the end'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'I do at the moment, sympathize, that's a nice colour'

Pauline: 'It is, innit?'

Pauline: 'That's good'

Larna: 'Just right for around indoors, yes that one's nice to'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Larna: 'I mean if they'd of banned it, there'd of been a lot more people out of work, which is'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'probably part of the reason why they didn't for the time being'

Pauline: 'That's right'

Larna: 'I like those jumpers too'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'Oh they've got rid of those white ones'

Pauline: 'Sweat shirt'

Pauline: 'Yeah Aaron's a seven'

Larna: 'Are they supposed to be like that then, different at the front?'

Pauline: 'It's just the way the pattern is'

Larna: 'Yeah, ah, I like the new pink ones, and that's for boys'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'That'll be just right for on holiday won't they?'

Pauline: 'Yeah, get two different colours'

Larna: 'Yeah, but the thing is right they're sevens and they're gonna be too small for them by the time holiday gets round say September'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Larna: 'that's the trouble'

Pauline: 'well Aaron's a six and they're seven so I'm safe to getting Aaron a seven'

Larna: 'I'm safe to getting mine sevens yeah'

Pauline: 'Yeah there's erm I think that's seven is it?
No it's an eight'

Larna: 'Mind you when the warmer weather gets here they can wear them anyway'

Pauline: 'Oh yeah'

Larna: 'What, if they ain't got the size you can't'

Pauline: 'Seven'

Larna: 'I think we've gone through all the sevens in the blacks ain't you?
It's only a five nine, they're nines there, have you got a watch on?'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'Oh good ah hang on er, three pairs there, seven, six and an eight, right there's two blacks in sevens here, well I'll just have a pair of each, I've only got a fiver in me purse just wondering whether to get black or blue though?'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Larna: 'The mauve's quite nice aren't they?
What do you reckon?
I don't know, they look a bit rough on the front to me they do'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Larna: 'don't they?'

Pauline: 'I'll just find a seven in the blue print'

Larna: 'Haven't we got any then?
Hang on they're alright on the front, want another seven don't you for Aaron?'

Pauline: 'Yeah cos the black's likely to go grey, whereas the blues don't look so bad'

Larna: 'No'

Pauline: 'when they go oh they've got socks there to go with them'

Larna: 'Mm, yeah I'm not too worried about her socks though but I say I'm gonna have plenty of Marks and Sparks' vouchers'

Larna: 'What have my two got?'

Pauline: 'I believe I can always pop in town tomorrow'

Larna: 'I was wondering actually I think I might wait until that dress comes through, I'll try'

Pauline: 'we can always ask to put them away for a week yeah that's what I might do'

Larna: 'Why?'

Pauline: 'Well then, if, we can put them away for a week'

Larna: 'Actually, actually wanted new trainers and they've got them there'

Pauline: 'Yeah they have ain't they?'

Pauline: 'No I'm not bothered about going on holiday, I suppose I'm all worked up about getting bedroom sorted, ha'

Larna: 'Mm, I said to Tony if we can't afford to go I said don't worry about it, we might just go back down to where we went last year for a week because, it's like I was saying to Joanne this morning, that this year they won't, they're not gonna worry whether they don't go on holiday but next year when Charlotte's at school and got all her school mates saying oh where did you go and'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'you know what it's like.'

Pauline: 'Erm yeah you got on, on the advert on the television you've got a P C, which one is it?
You haven't seen it obviously'

[UNK]: 'I've seen the advert it's embarrassing'

[UNK]: 'it's probably either the five, oh dear, I don't know actually, we actually do several P Cs in the'

Pauline: 'Yes I know'

[UNK]: 'because we're only a small branch, we only carry like one or two maybe'

Pauline: 'Mm'

[UNK]: 'at the most, erm is it I B M or'

Pauline: 'No it's an Amstrad'

[UNK]: 'An Amstrad, is it five O or five two eight six?'

Pauline: 'I can't remember, that's what I've come in to find out'

[UNK]: 'It could be the five two eight there's a five two eighty sixty two which is, about two hundred pounds, which is like a better machine'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

[UNK]: 'erm which we do, which we haven't got in stock at the moment, but we can always get hold of'

Pauline: 'Right, well I think the best thing to do is to leave it until I see the advert again'

[UNK]: 'It's so just enquiring on the catalogue interest, we've only got that one'

Pauline: 'Leaflets, brochure?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, yeah, is it the games pack one?'

Pauline: 'No it wouldn't be the games pack, it'd be after that one'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, so erm Microsoft Works game pack erm see do that, so many in the range now these are like our, our highlighted deal ones you see'

[UNK]: 'erm see there's five five eight six which is this one, it's forty'

[UNK]: 'hard drive'

Pauline: 'the Basingstoke's a larger branch aren't they?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah they, they, they have a business centre as well you see, erm'

Pauline: 'Right'

[UNK]: 'we can always get hold of the stuff here, save you lugging it around because they come in big boxes and that'

Pauline: 'Yeah, yeah'

[UNK]: 'it's not a problem so if you just want to have a look round up there and sort of come here'

Pauline: 'Yeah we've got relations in Basingstoke, so'

[UNK]: 'Yeah'

Pauline: 'we can have a look down there tomorrow'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, we can always get hold of them it's just that we don't carry them, we're a small branch you see'

Pauline: 'Right'

[UNK]: 'we've not got a big room'

Pauline: 'No'

[UNK]: 'so'

Pauline: 'okay then'

[UNK]: 'unfortunately, but, I, I would give you one of these, but I can't even give you one of these'

Pauline: 'But you haven't got one'

[UNK]: 'No, they only send us about three from the'

[UNK]: 'I believe they should be out in the like the National Press and things like that'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

[UNK]: 'I'd imagine because they usually put it in'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

[UNK]: 'things like the magazines the colour supplements and things like that'

Pauline: 'Right'

[UNK]: 'but yeah the Basingstoke branch is the business centre and their business centre is like the size of this shop so it's'

Pauline: 'Right'

[UNK]: 'And they've got a lot more and they would have them up and running as well'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

[UNK]: 'so you could compare different ones and things like that'

Pauline: 'Right I shall have to leave Gary in there for half an hour then'

Larna: 'Just drop him off and go to a canteen'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

[UNK]: 'but'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Larna: 'Didn't you go last week?'

Pauline: 'No'

Larna: 'why?'

Pauline: 'Well I got home, I got everything all sorted out, Gary even left a message on the answerphone saying that he'd be home round about half past two and that'

Larna: 'Mm'

Pauline: 'and erm, ha, got home, didn't wanna go out, there was me I got changed, I put on those new leggings I was all in black I thought I looked rather nice, you know, and Gary said what you all dressed up for?

You go along each line and you find a D there but there's no Os next to it is there?

Charlotte: 'Mum I find it, C, that number, that number, that number'

Larna: 'Yeah, but they don't join up Charlotte and then you cross and then you cross it out'
