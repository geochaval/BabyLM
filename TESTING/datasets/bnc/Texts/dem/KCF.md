It's only a little tiny country.
The Conservatives are trying to stop it.
Th they're trying to get it through, the bill through. [UNK]'

Herbert: 'No, Labour will allow them in.
Course, what you've got to think of, Conservatives are the one that started it in the first place.
So they've gotta try and kill it off now.
But the Labour won't.
But they didn't start it.
Some things are very complicated [UNK] Alison.
You've got to thingybob all through everything.
Anything else you wanna know?'

Alison: 'I think what I'll do is erm when [UNK] [UNK] totally confused about what they're gonna do and who's gonna be what and [UNK]'

Herbert: 'Well you've got to weigh up that and you've got to read the manifesto when it comes out.
What they're going to do for you. [UNK]'

Alison: 'Yes but they don't put it in words like you put, they put it in blooming complicated language, but tell lies.'

Herbert: 'Don't, read between the lines.
See me and your mum'll know that.
We'll read between the lines.'

Herbert: 'Well no'

Alison: 'It just means that they're not gonna do it.'

Herbert: 'Yeah.

Gordon: 'Mhm.'

Alison: 'Well they the new ones on the front would they do that?
Brand new, brand new one.
Same as that.
They're still building.
I think this is why they can't sell cos they keep building on and people are going in the newer ones and not buying the ones that are lived in.
And it's all all [UNK]'

Iris: 'Well you don't want a big roaring place do you?'

Gordon: 'Oh heck, no!'

Iris: 'I mean, you're not gonna fill it with children are you?'

A big garden!'

Iris: 'I mean, we got a dining room that we use about three times a year!'

That one that that bloke had in Wrexham, he'd got a go, good one there!
Little bungalow.
And like then, like dad said if you've got a decent sized garden at the back if you wanna extend you can put an extension on the back can't you?'

Iris: 'You can't extend on there.'

Alison: 'No, cos it's a [UNK] one.'

Iris: 'It all depends what you're looking for Alison.
You've just gotta make your mind up.'

Alison: 'Yeah but the thing is, it's something that we've got to think for life really, or we're just gonna be in the same situation in a couple of years that we wanna something a bit bigger.'

Iris: 'That's right.'

Alison: 'Won't we?
I mean, we could be in a predicament that we've got to stay in there cos nobody will buy it!
So how many houses are up for sale now?'

Iris: 'Prices are gonna come down aren't they?'

Gordon: 'Yeah.
But I said that and sort of just holding on a level now like, isn't it?'

Iris: 'Yeah, but I mean'

Gordon: 'But erm but there's a lot trying to be sold like, isn't there?
As you say they've gotta come down and probably we'll have to talk to them.
To get, you know get the sales.'

Iris: 'The thing is if you're getting one that's lived in you're most likely to get the carpets and things like that in.'

Gordon: 'Yeah.
I mean like this.'

Iris: 'A brand new one you've got to fit haven't you?'

Gordon: 'Yeah.'

Alison: 'Mm.'

Iris: 'And even if you buy a cheap carpet to start with it's not gonna last long as i, i, i'

Gordon: 'No, no.'

Iris: 'you know you've gotta yo, you're talking a thousand for carpets!'

Gordon: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

Iris: 'Not many people that's lived in a house take the carpets cos they won't fit wherever else they're going.'

Gordon: 'No, well that's it, they just'

Alison: 'Especially if it's smaller ones cos they're probably moving onto a bigger house.'

Iris: 'Yeah.
I don't know what you wanna big roaming house for?'

Alison: 'I don't want a big roaming house, but I want a decent sized house and with a bit of garden!
I'm not asking for much mother!
Are we?'

Iris: 'It's what you live in I think.
I mean, you're not gonna be it's not as though you're gonna be having people staying or erm I mean if you're gonna get a little place with a little single bed in'

Alison: 'Can't invite people [UNK].'

Iris: 'you can't invite people to stay.
Can you?'

Alison: 'Nope!'

Iris: 'It's I know, it's a place of your own, it's your own and it's not a big place to keep clean is it?'

Iris: 'I mean, the more space you have, the more muck you'll make!'

Alison: 'I know.'

Gordon: 'And also it'll the bound to be building and that it'll, you watch them [UNK].'

Iris: 'You're right.
Yeah.'

Gordon: 'They'll each go up with [UNK].'

Iris: 'Doesn't give the rateable value on'

Gordon: 'No.'
