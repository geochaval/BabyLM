Vera: 'When are you gonna start learning to play Chinese patience?'

Murray: 'I haven't got the patience.'

Vera: 'Well you could learn.
It's not a game I can play on my own.
It's quite a good game actually.

## 042905

Vera: 'Right.
Have you got enough there?'

Vera: 'Right I was just reading here about about er er the funeral in Northern Ireland and the minister wouldn't let the erm flag draped coffins of two I R A go into the church with the insignia and whatever on top of the coffins there.
And then there's one about the erm a protestant pastor blamed the seventeen year old death, that fellow that, that young man in the video shop that was erm shot down the father blamed the British government.
He said if the, if he, he was shot dead at a Belfast video shop, he said if this was happening in England or on the streets of London the response of the government would be totally different well it has happened in London.
It has happened in London, what about all the shootings and bombings?'

Murray: 'Oh er er I understand, yeah.'

## 042907

Murray: 'I wonder if they can deduce what that is?'

Vera: 'Just reading here where it says that erm B and Q they're having a slanging match with Texas cutting all their prices paints tools they're trying to outdo them with the prices.
They've got the whole page in the paper.'

Murray: 'They'll be throwing rocks at each down here at Fleets Bridge.'

## 042908

Vera: 'Look it says here that bridging the Watford Gap.
Two families discover how the divide between the north and the south is narrowing.
Now Northampton is twenty one miles from Bedford now we were never classed as living in the south when we lived there.
And yet'

Murray: 'No.'

Vera: 'they're saying Bedford is in the south.
Bedford is definitely not in the south.
Bedford is in the south midlands the same as Northampton was, and is, I should say.
And it says two families discover how the divide between the north and south is narrowing.
Bedford is not in the south!
Bedford is in the midlands, it's the south east midlands.'

Murray: 'There is an imaginary line, or they used to call it from Birmingham to the Wash anything below that is the south.'

Vera: 'Well it's not the south is it?
I mean to me they've, London is classed as the south.'

Murray: 'Bedford is more south east.'

Vera: 'It's south east midlands, it isn't the south east.
It's the, it's the south, southern midlands, south midlands.
It's twenty one miles from Northampton, they never cla I mean down here people think Northampton is in the north.
[UNK] Northampton you see and they think it's up the north.'

Murray: 'Well it is, hundred and forty three miles north of here.'

Vera: 'Yeah it's not the north is it?
It's the, it's the south midlands.
It used to be the south east midlands, now it's classed as the south midlands but Bedford, twenty one miles along the road there, and they call it the south.
Well it certainly isn't.'

Murray: 'Well where do these people live?'

Vera: 'Well erm two families discover how the divide between north and south is narrowing and one lives at Wigan one family lives at Wigan and the other family, no er yeah the other family live at Bedford.
And two families discover how the the divide between the two is narrowing.'

Murray: 'Yeah.'

Vera: 'After three years of property slump in the home counties it has never been easier to leap over the Watford Gap by moving from the north to the south.
They're talking about the Watford Gap, not about Watford itself.
The Watford Gap is a service station isn't it, on the M one?'

Murray: 'Yeah.'

Vera: 'Watford is erm when you used to come out on the old'

Murray: 'I know where Watford is.'

Vera: 'I shall have to read it, it's about two families, they're changing directions.
There's another one here Knutsford, Stratford-upon-Avon, now'

Murray: 'Yeah.'

Vera: 'since when has Stratford on Avon been south?
That again you see Northampton lays be in the middle of those two, it's twenty one miles to Bedford one side and thirty miles to Stratford on Avon the other side.
And they class it as the south.
Bloody ridiculous.'

Murray: 'Well it is, technically speaking, south of a'

Vera: 'If you lived in'

Murray: 'given point.'

Vera: 'well if you lived in Scotland, Stratford on Avon is south, anywhere is south isn't it, in England?
I expect you'd say Stratford on Avon is south.
Mind you any, I wouldn't wanna move from Stratford on Avon if I lived there to go and live further north.
Stratford on Avon is a lovely place.
Quite expensive to live there I'd think.
Think the property's quite expensive.
But it's certainly a nice place to live.'

Murray: 'Ah it would be because er you have to pay for being near the bard.'

Vera: 'Oh I don't know about that.
No it's a pretty place.'

Murray: 'As long as it doesn't clash with'

## 042912

Murray: 'But they haven't said too much about it in the paper.'

Vera: 'No I mean usually they show you on the T V when they're leaving don't they?
But I think they, they probably play it down a bit these days.
There's a picture of her here and er cheering Australians welcome the queen to Sidney with a banner proclaiming good day Betty Betty!'

Vera: 'Can you imagine anybody here doing that to the queen?
Good day Betty, that just shows, doesn't it, how erm the sort of respect or disrespect, whatever you'd like to'

Murray: 'Yeah.'

Vera: 'call it, they have got for royalty because to call the queen Betty, she's smiling but I wonder if she feels like smiling.
It says thousands have packed city centre to cheer her and it said the fervour surprised republicans who have criticized the visit.
