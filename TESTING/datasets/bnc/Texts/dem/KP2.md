[UNK]: 'And Carla miss'

Gabriel: 'I called your name [UNK] I did'

Carla: 'Carla'

Gabriel: 'Carla, Carla oh you were here last week when'

Carla: 'yeah'

Gabriel: 'Carla [UNK]'

Carla: 'yeah'

Gabriel: 'I'm slowly getting to know names, it's the twenty seventh?'

Carla: 'yeah'

Papya: 'Yeah'

Gabriel: 'okay, rightio then, well last week we used our bodies last week d'ya remember what we did?, can you put your bag down please, take your jackets off, what do you think this is?, come on, nobody else here in the room [UNK] okay, so last week we [UNK] we did [UNK] if you remember, erm, now this week we're going to do some sound tracks'

Carla: 'can I borrow this?'

Gabriel: 'gonna make some sound machines alright'

Papya: 'I can't I can't'

Gabriel: 'obviously we've got to work together on all, are you listening to me?, on all the different parts of the body, you want them all to come alive, okay, so, this week as I say we're gonna concentrate on sound, sound, sound, sound, you've got to play [UNK] on sound [UNK] that is the painting, I mean the, the pictures do you, alright that's fine, at the same doesn't matter we've still got to work on different things, yeah, okay?, erm, so, as I say we're going to make a sound machine in different groups, now to give you an example, what I what you to do is be, I'm going to give you a situation, give, choose a profession, okay, let's say we are in hospital, now I want you each and everyone of you in this group think of the situation, think of a sound that one might hear in a hospital, everyone to themselves just think of a sound, could be a patient screaming, it could be a heart machine, it could be, er exactly, could be that, could be absolutely anything, it could sirens, it could be anything, okay, for everyone I want you to have the sound in your head okay, everyone's got a sound in their head?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah'

Gabriel: 'just an example, now when I come round and tap you, I want you to make your sound and will you keep on making that sound repeatedly until I clap like that and tell you to stop, okay, so if I tap you'

Carla: 'go on'

Gabriel: 'you make your sound and you carry on and on and on, I'm gonna keep on taping different people's make their sound and then we're gonna see what it feels like you're in hospital, okay, now it doesn't matter if somebody's got the same sound as somebody else, it's no big deal, alright, because eventually they'll all blend into each other, but as soon as I've tapped you, make your sound, alright [UNK] patients, come on where's the machines? okay, stop, now when did it start becoming out of hand?, at one stage we didn't really know where we were to, once, once I [UNK] say ten people, okay, and that was also due to the fact that we had perhaps too many erm patients moaning, alright, it was good in one respect because why, it made obvious that we were in a, a hospital well something like [UNK], but erm when you're in smaller groups and you're making your sound machines, obviously it's much easier to to control and to make the overall sound more realistic, don't you think?, so, mm, what we're going to do is we're going to get into different groups, into groups of four, five, no big deal, you're welcome to only if you want to, and, you're going to, each group is going to choose er a profession, okay, you can be brick layers, you can be er musicians, er you can be er gardener, I mean absolutely you can be factory workers, you can be absolutely anything, and what you're going to do is you're going to choose, each person will choose a sound which is represented of that particular person, er profession, okay, and you'll going to make your sounds simultaneously so that as for the audience who are simply listening to you can just close our eyes cos we won't, you won't be acting you'll be making these sounds and using, we'll close our eyes and we'll know exactly where we are, okay, and then after that once we've done that just, before you choose your profession to know what this is going to lead onto, after that we're going to put movements to that profession, so when, if you were in a factory going er putting bottles on, on top top of bottles, you would have the movements going and you would have the sound going and I want you to build up, up, the sound machine which becomes the movement machine as well, so you're almost robotic so you, shh, shh, or whatever, however your sound, and each person does their thing in the factory or where ever they are and we will be able to see from listening and looking at the movements and obviously remember just because you're not an example it doesn't mean you can't talk, there might be for instance there would be a doctor going stand back, stand back, you know, er, in, in the [UNK] you can use voices, but also obviously very, very effective to have sound voices, shh, shh, to create that part of it, have instruments, but this is how they actually started lay down sound tracks for movies, people specialize'

Gabriel: 'that it came to make the amazing sounds, okay, and then after that, er, this is another thing it leads to is there's going to be a break down in your sound machine, okay, there's gonna be a break down in your, in your entire robotic machine, movement in our machine, and that break down could be due to some of the workers going off and getting [UNK] some of them erm you know, one, er part of the machine breaking down on the whole, sound changes, the movement changes and we're going to watch how this robotic machine changes as it breaks down, it could be sound shut down it could be it could be anything you choose, but I want it anyway, leave it to you so all you do is choose a profession, think of something that is, comes to life to you, in movement and in sound, okay, so let's get into groups of, see how many they are, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, okay let's get into groups of four then, okay is that right, one, two, three, four, one, oh five, four, five, just get your group into a work in, I thank you if you don't get'

Carla: 'Vanessa'

Gabriel: 'into groups yourself I'll put you in groups'

Gabriel: 'come on into your groups please'

Carla: 'come on then'

Gabriel: 'quickly er can I see people not working properly?'

Gabriel: 'you've got three what you got, can you work in your three?'

Carla: 'yes, we can'

Gabriel: 'okay, would you like to have one more?'

Carla: 'we can work in the three'

Gabriel: 'you'd like to work in the three? one more just simply because it's, it gives you more sound impulse'

Carla: 'okay'

Gabriel: 'is it going to be difficult to get one of them [UNK]'

Carla: 'I don't know cos there're all together'

Gabriel: 'yes, okay, you three go and make your sound, means that you have'

Carla: 'okay'

Gabriel: 'each one of you have to be louder and also it also means that you can make, one person can make more than one sound, okay, work it like, just you can substitute for the other two'
