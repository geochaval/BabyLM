Gearoid: 'With root ginger or powdered ginger.'

Rachel: 'It's root ginger.
It's delicious!'

Gearoid: 'Very strong.'

Rachel: 'Cos it's very subtle.'

Anne-Marie: 'But it's in a'

Rachel: 'Oh I'

Anne-Marie: 'packet is it?'

Rachel: 'It's actually very subtle.'

Gearoid: 'Mhm.'

Rachel: 'It's delicious.
So many people when they eat it, they can't actually decipher what it has, you know what it is, that it is ginger.'

Gearoid: 'Yes.'

Rachel: 'It's very subtle.'

Gearoid: 'I think Margaret doesn't understand the word subtle.'

Gearoid: 'Cos she takes about two pounds of root ginger peels it'

Rachel: 'Really?'

Gearoid: 'and chops it'

Gearoid: 'and puts it with a pound of Philadelphia cheese into the cavity of the chicken outside it's just lightly rubbed with oil'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Gearoid: 'and then about two ounces of powdered ginger sprinkled over it.'

Rachel: 'Two ounces as well as all the ginger?'

Gearoid: 'And puts it into roast in the oven, and takes it out after fifty minutes and then you get Philadelphia cheese and white wine melt it down in the wine'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm!'

Gearoid: 'stirring a bit more you know, crushed root ginger'

Gearoid: 'I could eat the tail.'

Rachel: 'Really?'

Gearoid: 'It's gorgeous.
But i, I keep saying to Michael it's so expensive!
I mean root ginger's like a pound a pound, or two pound a pound.'

Michael: 'No, not really.
It's not, it's not as expensive as it used to be.
It's got more and more popular strangely enough.'

Gearoid: 'But she does ginger tea.'

Michael: 'Oops.
So do I?'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh I haven't drunk ginger tea before.'

Gearoid: 'Well I'll make you ginger tea.'

Rachel: 'Well we never tried that before.'

Anne-Marie: 'But that's sounds what, can I just ask again, so you have a roast chicken yo, and you mix two'

Gearoid: 'A pound of Philadelphia cheese.'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.'

Gearoid: 'But she does about two pound of root ginger.
Most normal people would have half a pound at the most.'

Michael: 'That's two good roots.'

Anne-Marie: 'You crush it or do you chop'

Gearoid: 'Two whole, bash it.'

Anne-Marie: 'it up?
Bash it?'

Gearoid: 'Bash, bash.'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.
And you put that, mix that in'

Gearoid: 'Mix in.'

Anne-Marie: 'with the Philadelphia'

Gearoid: 'Into the cavity.'

Anne-Marie: 'Right.
And'

Gearoid: 'yo'

Anne-Marie: 'then after'

Gearoid: 'and then'

Anne-Marie: 'fifty minutes'

Gearoid: 'oil it, oil'

Michael: 'It's [UNK]'

Gearoid: 'the outside'

Michael: 'as if it's full'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.'

Michael: 'and moist.'

Gearoid: 'Put the ground,'

Gearoid: 'the ground ginger'

Michael: 'the the'

Anne-Marie: 'Mhm.'

Michael: 'you know, the powdered stuff.'

Gearoid: 'Philadelphia cheese cooked in and'

Anne-Marie: 'Cheese and everything inside.'

Gearoid: 'keeping the whole chicken [UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Gearoid: 'And then roast it.'

Rachel: 'And then after fifty minutes you do the melt the'

Michael: 'She, well she cooks her chicken for only fifteen minutes, but I would cook my chicken'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh.'

Michael: 'longer.'

Rachel: 'Yeah.
Are we talking about a roast, a whole chicken?'

Gearoid: 'A ro, a whole chicken.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Rachel: 'Fifteen minutes?'

Gearoid: 'Fifty.'

Michael: 'Fifty.'

Rachel: 'Oh fifty.'

Anne-Marie: 'That's still pretty short'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Gearoid: 'It'

Anne-Marie: 'isn't it?'

Gearoid: 'it's about an hour and a half to cook a chicken.'

Anne-Marie: 'But'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'you could cook, you could cook it'

Anne-Marie: 'for longer with that inside couldn't you?'

Rachel: 'Fifty, fifty and I wouldn't want to eat it.'

Michael: 'Right.'

Anne-Marie: 'Couldn't you?'

Michael: 'It's very moist.'

Gearoid: 'I don't like overcooked chicken.
I like it'

Anne-Marie: 'But that'd be pink?'

Rachel: 'Do you like it pink?
So, surely'

Michael: 'Mm.'

Rachel: 'yeah, it'll still be pink.'

Anne-Marie: 'I thought you had to be quite careful with chicken.'

Gearoid: 'Well, you're not gonna be [UNK]'

Michael: 'Well we only ever use Marks and Spencers free range chicken.'

Rachel: 'We we used to have these in Dublin didn't we?'

Michael: 'Can we give this dog'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.'

Michael: 'some chickens?'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh don't!
I'll have to try that one in, in Dublin, tell Molly I've been.'

Rachel: 'That sounds wonderful!'

Gearoid: 'It's still a good thing to try.'

Michael: 'Yeah, we do a well of course we, [UNK] we used to make contact with who, were having a dinner party that we went to.
That's why we do all our entertaining [UNK] one at a time.'

Anne-Marie: 'Why do you only use Marks and Spencers' chickens.'

Michael: 'Sheila says they're the best in England.'

Anne-Marie: 'Really?'

Michael: 'She won't have anything else in the hotel.
If there's a chicken dish in the hotel chickens don't come from our suppliers, they come from Marks and Spencers.'

Anne-Marie: 'Do Marks and Spencers'

Rachel: 'So you just freeze them do you?'

Anne-Marie: 'obviously you get them then from in bulk from'

Michael: 'I just [UNK].
No.'

Rachel: 'What you just go to the supermarkets and buy a whole of chickens?'

Michael: 'Mhm.'

Rachel: 'Really?'

Gearoid: 'That's our extravagance.'

Michael: 'Excuse me, er, for a moment.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'Well she thinks they're far superior to anybody'

Anne-Marie: 'Can I help you?'

Michael: 'else's.'

Gearoid: 'Yeah.
The napkins'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm!'

Gearoid: 'are napkins that we've been buying in antique fairs.'

Anne-Marie: 'Have you?'

Rachel: 'Are they really?'

Gearoid: 'I think'

Anne-Marie: 'they starch them though.'

Gearoid: 'Oh well I have them ordered.'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'We have them ordered.
Are they nice?'

Anne-Marie: 'They are beautiful!'

Michael: 'Yeah.'

Anne-Marie: 'They really are lovely.'

Michael: 'We got about a hundred napkins upstairs.'

Michael: 'Yeah.
The napkins to well cheaper than buying new ones isn't it?'

Rachel: 'Mm mm!'

Gearoid: 'Yes.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'You get them for two pounds fifty.
Four pounds.
Five pounds each.'

Rachel: 'They're wonderful aren't they?'

Michael: 'You go to Peter [UNK] and pay that for an ordinary'

Rachel: 'Mm mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh yeah.'

Michael: 'what d'ya call it, kind of'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'I just thought that was absolutely delicious!'

Gearoid: 'Dave [UNK] has a gorgeous recipe for erm Teriyaki beef.
On the menu of Biggs.'

Rachel: 'Oh what's'

Anne-Marie: 'Really?'

Rachel: 'that?'

Gearoid: 'She puts the pickled ginger on one side and another, like a Japanese horseradish called Wasabe which is green don't try it, it'll blow your head off!'

Anne-Marie: 'Really?'

Rachel: 'Oh yeah.'

Gearoid: 'And th, the, the sort of steak is then it's er cooked like soya sauce'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh yeah.'

Gearoid: 'and marinated'

Rachel: 'Mm mm!'

Gearoid: 'then it's served in strips.
Just delicious!'

Anne-Marie: 'Is, is it expensive to eat Biggs?'

Anne-Marie: 'Really?'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Rachel: 'Oh I was just thinking, it'd be nice to go there.
I didn't think it would be'

Gearoid: 'The starters are about nine pounds to in at thirty five for caviar.'

Anne-Marie: 'Really?'

Gearoid: 'Main courses are about eighteen to twenty eight.
And the puddings make about sixty pounds.'

Anne-Marie: 'So it's sixty pounds each'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'then?'

Gearoid: 'Yeah.'

Anne-Marie: 'And that's for the'

Gearoid: 'Plus your booze.'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'And is the drink very expensive?'

Gearoid: 'Ya.
Her mark-up is about so what I normally do, she has never ever told me to pay for anything.
And she says go and have a meal'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh yeah.'

Gearoid: 'then'

Rachel: 'Yeah.'

Gearoid: 'you know, and if anybody else does, they do but I always insist on paying for my drinks.'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.'

Gearoid: 'And'

Anne-Marie: 'Thank you.
Which one?'

Gearoid: 'she obviously didn't know this for a long time and then one day I said to her, well, it was lovely meal and all that but I do think your mark-up on the wine is scandalous!'

Anne-Marie: 'What did she say?'

Gearoid: 'Of course I get a staff discount.'

Rachel: 'Really?'

Gearoid: 'She says well I know, and you know that that bottle of wine costs'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Gearoid: 'ten ninety five and, and we had two bottles last night so it costs us sixty pounds.
Well done Michael.
Who's making Gearoid pay?
Nobody makes me pay for it, I always pay for my drinks.'

Anne-Marie: 'Really?'

Gearoid: 'So it was murder!'

Rachel: 'Really?'

Gearoid: 'I said I would never go back again'

Rachel: 'I'll help you Michael.'

Michael: 'No, I'll, I'll do it, it's okay.
I'm all under control'

Rachel: 'Are you sure?'

Michael: 'now.'

Gearoid: 'She wouldn't let me pay for it.'

Anne-Marie: 'Really?'

Gearoid: 'So fair to say, the staff are depending on their tips to supplement their salary'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.'

Gearoid: 'so if I don't pay anything'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.'

Gearoid: 'they've lost that'

Anne-Marie: 'Yes.
Right.'

Gearoid: 'ability of earning that money'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.'

Gearoid: '[UNK], so'

Anne-Marie: 'You can't leave a tip regardless?'

Gearoid: 'Well, Michael always leaves a tip.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Gearoid: 'But what we've done now they've agreed to let me pay and I pay cost price for the drinks.'

Anne-Marie: 'Right.'

Gearoid: 'So we can drink ourselves silly and get a bill for about ten pounds.'

Anne-Marie: 'And all that wonderful food!'

Rachel: 'Oh that's very good isn't it?'

Michael: 'I'm looking forward to the sweet I must'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'say.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'Thank you for dinner.'

Gearoid: 'Maybe Thursday.'

Rachel: 'Have you got a busy week now Michael?'

Michael: 'Well Tuesday is my busiest day.
I'm getting'

Rachel: 'What?'

Michael: 'some more in.'

Rachel: 'Oh really?'

Michael: 'Yeah.
That's alright.'

Rachel: 'Cos they're around then?'

Michael: 'Yeah.'

Anne-Marie: 'And how long are yours away for?'

Michael: 'Too long.
Monday morning, four A M they landed.'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh!
So you'll have a an awful week then as usual?'

Michael: 'Well I'm hoping I'm going to have a nice week but it Mavis [UNK], my housekeeper's away until Wednesday so I can't leave the house during the day.'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh right.'

Michael: 'Because the morning maid goes home at one o'clock and doesn't come back again until six.
[UNK] the gardener comes.'

Anne-Marie: 'Yes.'

Michael: 'I can't just go off and have a look for somebody or'

Rachel: 'Mm mm.'

Michael: 'go wandering down the high street can I?
Or whatever.'

Anne-Marie: 'No.'

Rachel: 'Mm mm.'

Michael: 'So Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday I fully intend to [UNK].
Cos I never ever have time off.'

Rachel: 'I know, you said before you hardly miss a lunch.'

Michael: 'Never.
Which is crazy!
I mean, I really do resent it sometimes.'

Anne-Marie: 'I'm not surprised.'

Anne-Marie: 'Yes.'

Michael: 'Cos it's dark in the morning when I go into work and it's dark when I'm going home in the evenings.
It's getting a bit ridiculous!
It's getting [UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'And does provide food for you to have?'

Michael: 'Occasionally.
I mean, at the moment there's no housekeeper so unless I actually say to the maid will you just put something in the oven for me?
That's it.'

Anne-Marie: 'That's appalling though!'

Michael: 'And on, on erm Thursday Thursday evening before they were going out to Mark [UNK] she came home at just about half one.'

Michael: 'She came and made me a ham sandwich and the maid just look at her [UNK] to eat it now.'

Rachel: 'Brilliant!'

Michael: 'There really was not a scrap of [UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'That's awful!'

Rachel: 'Because the housekeeper sorts all that out, so when she's away no one does it?'

Michael: 'But she bought all these things for me from Marks and Spencers, you know breaded chicken and'

Rachel: 'Mm mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'breasts.'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.'

Michael: 'I put them all in the deep freeze.
Unless you think about it, you know the day before or the'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah'

Rachel: 'Yeah.'

Michael: 'morning you come in.'

Rachel: 'But surely you can just defrost it in the microwave?'

Michael: 'She doesn't have a microwave.'

Anne-Marie: 'Does she not?
Why doesn't she use a'

Michael: 'She doesn't like them.'

Anne-Marie: 'microwave?'

Michael: 'Doesn't like them.'

Anne-Marie: 'But she bought you one.'

Rachel: 'She get you one.'

Michael: 'That was quite funny because it was our first Christmas down there and I was saying to the housekeeper that I I wouldn't mind having people come and stay and [UNK] not a problem because we've got a lovely cooker and we're going to bring our microwave down from [UNK].
Said it's electric, I'm just going to unplug it and bring it down and put it on the work top.
The only thing is that it's chocolate brown and my kitchen's all white.
And she did and so I think two days before Christmas Lady [UNK] said to me, okay I shall go into Peter [UNK] and choose whatever microwave you want.
Just charge it to my account.
That's right.'

Anne-Marie: 'What?'

Michael: 'She said well you can't be carrying microwaves around England every time you want to have a meal.
And just, I know that's what, you haven't got one in the cottage and there you are, go and get it.'

Anne-Marie: 'She's so generous isn't she?'

Rachel: 'Yeah.'

Michael: 'There was no kind of'

Michael: 'pricing mentioned.'

Michael: 'I went to Peter [UNK]'

Michael: 'and looked at, you know, little ones, and huge ones'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh yeah.'

Michael: 'and things that did that thing and washing up and all the rest'

Michael: 'and I thought what am I going to do?'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Michael: 'Cos I mean I wasn't with her that long.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'It was like my first Christmas.
And what was considered acceptable and what was considered being bloody greedy!'

Rachel: 'Yeah.'

Michael: 'I said to the guy, how many of these could I actually walk out with?
And he said none.
They're all display models?
I said what have you got in the so, you know, warehouse on Sloane Avenue in'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'white?
Oh I think that was one of two.
The other one was like four hundred and ninety nine pounds.
So, I'll take it.
I didn't know, I didn't even know what I was taking.'

Anne-Marie: 'Really?'

Michael: 'I still haven't a clue of what er the'

Michael: 'the pamphlet, it's far too complicated for me.
She's like that.
I mean, she's really sweet.'

Rachel: 'Mm mm.'

Michael: 'I'm very careful never to admire things or enthuse about things.'

Anne-Marie: 'Because she's likely to give them to you?'

Michael: 'Because she's likely to give them to you.
I mean, she knows I love Gardenia'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Michael: 'and because she was in Mustique and hadn't bought me a birthday present she made sure that there were two Gardenia plants at the party that night she bought me.'

Anne-Marie: 'Really?'

Michael: 'She's like that.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'She knows we love the pink champagne.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Michael: 'The brand is in.
And it's not kind of standard champagne in the place but she always keeps a supply.
Always has champagne.'

Gearoid: 'Got any champagne at home?
Get another bottle of that.'

Michael: 'He must be running low.'

Anne-Marie: 'You see I, I mean I know obviously the perks don't outweigh all that, er, at least you do get some perks.
At least you know, she can be generous and'

Michael: 'Yes.'

Gearoid: 'But she can be absolutely demonic there's no doubt about that.
She really can.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Gearoid: 'And she drives you insane!'

Rachel: 'Well like you said last time, I think only a man can put up with her.'

Gearoid: 'Mm.'

Rachel: 'That's probably why she got through so many women.'

Gearoid: 'I think she's on back on the right track as well with her.
She was in a rut.'

Rachel: 'Okay.'

Gearoid: 'Really?
There is more to life than worrying about how the maid's ironed your nightdress or you know.'

Anne-Marie: 'So she does have a housekeeper that lives in?'

Gearoid: 'No.
Now Molly's been with her since she first got married, you know.
She's a big Portuguese man-of-war.'

Anne-Marie: 'And then she has a maid?'

Gearoid: 'Who's very bitter.'

Rachel: 'Is she?
Why'

Gearoid: 'Well'

Rachel: 'is she bitter?'

Gearoid: 'well she's had a miserable life of her own kind of thing.'

Anne-Marie: 'She's not married?'

Gearoid: 'Doesn't like Sir Mark.
Her husband left her.'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh.'

Gearoid: 'Doesn't like Sir Mark.
I think resents him enormously.
He doesn't like her.'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh really?'

Gearoid: 'Because, you know, I understand that before he came along she was there you know, and that kind of situation'

Rachel: 'Yeah.'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.'

Gearoid: 'where you know, well it never used to be like that.'

Rachel: 'Is it'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Rachel: 'her first marriage then?'

Anne-Marie: 'This is the original'

Gearoid: '[UNK] what?
Lady [UNK]?'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.'

Gearoid: 'Third.'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh third!
Really?
I didn't know that.'

Gearoid: 'Number one was killed in a car crash?'

Anne-Marie: 'Really?'

Gearoid: 'And her, their children were not two and three years of age.'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh how awful!'

Gearoid: 'And the same week that he was killed, Sasha, her daughter was in Great Ormond Street having surgery for cancer of the brain.'

Rachel: 'That's appalling!'

Gearoid: 'So'

Anne-Marie: 'So she must have been quite young herself then?'

Gearoid: 'Oh ya.
She married at eighteen.
So yo, I have enormous respect for anyone who actually'

Rachel: 'Mm mm.'

Gearoid: 'through something like'

Anne-Marie: 'And so'

Gearoid: 'that.'

Anne-Marie: 'she just divorced the second one?'

Gearoid: 'Kind of a touchy subject.'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh right.'

Gearoid: 'He's Phil [UNK], the theatrical producer.
Got all these smash hits in the West End at the moment.
But, I don't know what the story is.

Michael: 'You had your day.'

Anne-Marie: 'Well I didn't tell you about my hot date on Wednesday.'

Michael: 'Ooh!
I didn't know you had one.
Tell me.'

Gearoid: 'Tell us.'

Anne-Marie: 'You know I had the choir concert last Saturday?'

Gearoid: 'Mhm.'

Anne-Marie: 'It was at a church in Hertford.
And we were completely frozen cos the boiler had broken down and we were there at two o'clock to rehearse.
And I had one rehearsal of two Bach pieces which were really difficult and I was com, feeling completely frantic during the break in rehearsal, and went over to look at the music and some fellow called Don bounded over to me and said, oh you can't be you know you sh can't be looking at that now, ba, la dee da dee da!
He must have heard that I'd come back from Ireland.
So, he was talking about Ireland, really raving about it and his name's Kennedy and he's from Liverpool and he likes to think he's got Irish blood in him, he's been there twice this year and'

Gearoid: 'Mhm.'

Anne-Marie: 'all that.
Really enthusing about it.
So we were chatting away about that.
And then erm after the rehearsal some of us went off to get a pizza before the concert and he said to me, erm are you interested in going to hear the Mozart Requiem, it's on at the Barbican on Wednesday?
So I said, yeah!
Co, I've always wanted to hear it, and as you know it's our next concert.
So erm that was fine, until after the concert'

Gearoid: 'Was that a subsidised concert by were all the tickets one price or not?'

Michael: 'At the Barbican?'

Anne-Marie: 'I don't know.
It was packed!
Princess Diana was there.'

Michael: 'I know.
That's it.'

Anne-Marie: 'Really.'

Rachel: 'She was?
She was there when you were there?'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.

Gearoid: 'Mm.'

Rachel: 'Oh really?'

Gearoid: 'All the tickets were'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Gearoid: 'one price.

Rachel: 'What was she wearing?'

Gearoid: 'it was sponsored.

Anne-Marie: 'Black and white.'

Gearoid: 'paper and thought well that would have been quite nice.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Rachel: 'Did you go with him?'

Anne-Marie: '[UNK] I'll come to that.'

Gearoid: 'You said yes did anyway.'

Anne-Marie: 'I said yes thinking Mozart would be lovely, and not thinking any more of it until he stuck to me like a limpet'

Anne-Marie: 'for the rest of the concert and the penny began to drop erm He said something about the tube station not being the most romantic place to meet and I kind of brushed it off by saying well at least we won't get wet there or something.'

Gearoid: 'Mm mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'And then he said er, I said to him about'

Anne-Marie: 'I've got to get the last train home.
He said don't worry, I have the winter timetable.
He's a train spotter.'

Anne-Marie: 'He's got a green anorak with toggles'

Michael: 'I see.'

Anne-Marie: 'on.
And'

Michael: 'I think it's better'

Anne-Marie: 'Don't!'

Rachel: 'Alright.'

Anne-Marie: 'He's tall but'

Anne-Marie: 'he's tall which is great.
No problem.
He's in his well actually probably pushing forty at this stage.
But, he's got he's got a a big round red face and little eyes'

Anne-Marie: 'and a moustache, and the most peculiar little bit under'

Michael: 'Bit, yes.'

Anne-Marie: 'there.
But really it's just like'

Rachel: 'What colour hair has he got?'

Anne-Marie: 'it's just, it's just like a bit like that'

Gearoid: 'But he's nice?'

Anne-Marie: 'which goes Mm mm!
But I kept hearing him like scrape it during the concert.'

Anne-Marie: 'I know.
But it'

Rachel: 'What col'

Anne-Marie: 'It's ju'

Rachel: 'What colour hair?'

Anne-Marie: 'Erm'

Michael: 'Does it matter?
When you have a [UNK] lobotomy!'

Michael: 'Especially when he's'

Anne-Marie: 'I don't know'

Michael: '[UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'Michael, Michael'

Rachel: 'Oh no.'

Anne-Marie: 'Michael's hair colour I suppose.
A bit like that.
And then he's got he's got a beard, except it's not very long going behind his jawline like Captain Ahab.
Do you remember?'

Michael: 'What?
Yes.'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.'

Anne-Marie: 'Kind of, out like that.
Really bizarre!
Weird.
Peculiar man.
He's head of er he's senior editor of classics at E M I, so he latched onto this sort of, you know'

Gearoid: 'Ah.'

Anne-Marie: 'ooh another thing in common, you know da da, da da.'

Gearoid: 'And did you'

Anne-Marie: 'So erm I was feeling a bit edgy about this when we were in the pub after the concert cos I thought maybe he's reading things into it and I, you know, I was just going along for the music.
So I thought, oh maybe I'm reading too much into it.
So I met him on Wednesday evening Tottenham Court Road tube station and er chat, chat, chat.
He, he talked so much we missed our stop.
In a very loud voice!'

Rachel: 'Did you?'

Anne-Marie: 'Yes.
Erm, and he kept touching me as well which really annoyed me!'

Gearoid: 'Oh oh!'

Anne-Marie: 'Well, I'm a bit of toucher myself and I, I don't mind if it's friends or family or someone I'm keen on'

Michael: 'Oh yeah.'

Anne-Marie: 'that doesn't bother me, but considering it was only the second I'd spoken to him and I did not fancy him in the least erm, it really made my skin crawl.
And erm first couple of times I kind of didn't respond, and the next few times I was literally flinching'

Gearoid: 'Mm mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'and moving away, like, hint, hint.
But he liked gripped me on the arm and then his hand would appear from nowhere during the concert, he like kind of rubbed my arm and are you alright?
[UNK]. Oh it was just a nightmare!
I, I know I'm a real bitch saying all this.
But, you know I think it, I thought it was his dingy grey suit to begin with that smelt of moth balls but it, it was his breath.
It was, I don't know how it smelt'

Anne-Marie: 'of moth balls.
And he kept guffaw and going,'

Anne-Marie: 'and get this awful blast of moth balls!'

Rachel: 'Really?'

Anne-Marie: 'It was, it was a complete nightmare!'

Rachel: 'Oh.'

Anne-Marie: 'And I, I wasn't prepared'

Anne-Marie: 'I wasn't prepared for for it at all'

Michael: 'Go on.'

Anne-Marie: 'because afterwards I, he had his arm round me when we were leaving and said oh well, I've really enjoyed this evening, we'll do it again won't we?
And I pulled away and I said, well erm I so enjoyed the Mozart I've always wanted to hear it.
Hint!
Hint!
I mean what could I do?
And then as we approached the tube station the arm around me again and erm and he'

Michael: 'But was he a fellow choir man as well?'

Anne-Marie: 'Yes!
It's awful you see because it's so'

Rachel: 'I would have been, been very rude to him.'

Anne-Marie: 'But no, but I can't couldn't afford to be rude to him, I've only just joined the choir.'

Michael: 'Well in future whenever he suggests something I think what you've got to do'

Gearoid: 'There's some in here.
Okay?'

Anne-Marie: 'I've got two here.'

Michael: 'is never you know, join the breaks or whatever and just make sure you're not left alone'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'you're with other girls.'

Anne-Marie: 'Well, I'm sorry, he just came on so strong.'

Michael: 'Mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'And, so I was forced into lying.
I said erm I've enjoyed the concert but I'm afraid'

Michael: 'Yeah.'

Anne-Marie: 'a, er you know, I don't want there to be any.
misunderstanding, and he, he said explain.
So I had to lie.'

Michael: 'Certainly.'

Anne-Marie: 'and I said erm, I'm going out with someone.
Cos I thought he hasn't taken any of my hints so far.
Erm, and he said, oh that sort of un, misunderstanding?
And then I thought I'd really put my foot in it and embarrassed both of us'

Michael: 'Ha.'

Anne-Marie: 'so there was silence until we got to the tube station and he said, how long have you been going out with this man?
Said oh I thought oh Becky would laugh if I told her this.
Well er, January, I think.
Mm.
Yes, about ten months I suppose.'

Anne-Marie: 'This phantom.'

Michael: 'Of the opera.'

Anne-Marie: 'And erm oh he was, oh very lucky man!
Blah, blah, blah.
I had high hopes of us.
Ooh he kept, but he kept I'd even worked out my train to, from Ealing down to'

Gearoid: 'Oh no!'

Anne-Marie: 'erm, Strawberry Hill.
Blah, blah, blah!'

Rachel: 'I'm sorry but I just think that is outrageous!'

Anne-Marie: 'Well I know.
So presumptuous.'

Rachel: 'Say, because I'm meeting someone that he'd plan out his'

Gearoid: 'Mm mm.'

Rachel: 'his route.'

Anne-Marie: 'He said, I hope I'm not embarrassing you but I believe in being frank.
Blah, blah.
And then to my horror'

Anne-Marie: 'er erm we changed to Embankment and he was supposed to go on the district line over to Ealing'

Michael: 'Yes.'

Anne-Marie: 'And I was going down to Waterloo for my train'

Michael: 'Mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'he said erm do you mind if I travel to Richmond with you?'

Michael: 'Oh!'

Anne-Marie: 'What could I say?
I mean no was ringing in my ears but I couldn't say that.
I mean, yes, I do mind.
Erm so we walked in and out of carriages as he sought a pair of seats together and erm squashed down, he had me like penned into the window, like I've got my bag and my umbrella in between ha, and I'd already told him I was going out with someone.
He was going like that to my face.
Like, I really felt abused.'

Anne-Marie: 'I mean at the time'

Gearoid: 'Ya.'

Anne-Marie: 'I felt sorry for him but I must admit when I got home and the following morning, and since then I've felt quite angry about it.'

Gearoid: 'That's [UNK]'

Michael: 'The next'

Gearoid: 'isn't it?'

Michael: 'the next time you see the girls in the choir'

Michael: 'I'll bet they'll turn round and say'

Anne-Marie: 'Well I, er, he ca, he was, he was then'

Michael: 'be careful of whatever his name is.'

Anne-Marie: 'he was then saying erm now what about a concert this Friday?
Erm, there's such and such going on.
And there's one er a week on Saturday, you know, let's go to both of those and I said erm I'm away those weekends.
I said, I'm going away this weekend, I'm going away next weekend'

Rachel: 'Yeah, let's not.'

Anne-Marie: 'and he said erm have you got your diary with you?
And I said no.
And he said, hadn't you better check?
And then he said, I don't mean to put pressure on, but I want to get to know you, we've got so much in common and erm I want to take you out for dinner, not just go to the concert, but, we don't get to know each other that way.
I'll come down to Richmond and take you out for dinner, how does that sound?
I said, I'll see you at choir.
But we don't get to see each other at the choir'

Anne-Marie: 'erm, because you don't stay back for a drink afterwards because you're going to Strawberry Hill.
I know it'll be easier when you're in Fulham, blah, blah, blah, but erm pressure!
Pressure.
Pressure.
Pressure.
Crowding me in.
And then he said'

Gearoid: 'Then it's, it's better to have a two-timer from'

Anne-Marie: 'then he said I'm lonely.'

Gearoid: 'Marks and Spencers.'

Gearoid: 'A lot easier to handle.'

Gearoid: 'Sorry Rachel.'

Anne-Marie: 'And then'

Rachel: 'No.'

Anne-Marie: 'he said that [UNK]'

Gearoid: 'I did that for your sister's benefit.'

Anne-Marie: 'I'm not a loner, I'm lonely.
He said, I haven't had a relationship since nineteen eighty.
I was married for a couple of years in the seventies.'

Michael: 'Poor woman'

Anne-Marie: 'I've got'

Michael: 'probably committed suicide!'

Rachel: 'I'm sorry.
He hasn't had a relationship since nineteen'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.'

Rachel: 'eighty?'

Anne-Marie: 'Did I forget to mention that?
Well, I'm sorry, the girls at work just fell about laughing.'

Rachel: 'Nineteen eighty?'

Anne-Marie: 'Nineteen eighty.
And I said, oh I'm sure there's someone'

Rachel: 'You ought to join Dateline or something.'

Anne-Marie: 'I said I'm there's somewhere out there for you.
And he was obviously really furious that I'd said that.
And I thought, yeah well I know I'd be cross if someone said to that me but I don't give a toss actually.'

Rachel: 'You should suggest that he join'

Rachel: 'Dateline and he sounds awful [UNK]'

Michael: 'We'll, we'll put him on Blind Date.
Shall we nominate him?'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.
And can you believe it erm'

Rachel: 'I don't believe [UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'Thursday night I was living in dread of the choir.
And I trundling along the district line to the Embankment across to Sloane Square and then hello, hello, I didn't expect to see you here.
Oh oh!
I never met anyone on the tube before from choir.
And I'm sure my face was a picture.
I was just'

Anne-Marie: 'appalled!'

Anne-Marie: 'I was just thinking about what a horrendous evening it had been the night before and then he'

Anne-Marie: 'confronted me'

Anne-Marie: 'with his awful beard and everything.
Oh I dunno.'

Michael: 'Is there anyone in'

Anne-Marie: 'And I had'

Michael: 'the choir that lives near you, or sca, can travel with you?'

Anne-Marie: 'Actually there's Paul, the guy who'd given me a lift to the concert and, and he mentioned going to the, the film I saw, erm but I knew he was going to the pub, he always goes to the pub afterwards.
So I pa, I told one girl in the choir what had happened, and I think to begin'

Michael: 'And what did she say?'

Anne-Marie: 'with she thought I was overreacting cos she didn't really respond.'

Michael: 'Is she married or what?'

Anne-Marie: 'And then, she is married.
Er erm and then later on I, I, I think maybe she did realize, you know, cos I said I wasn't prepared for that and that hasn't happened before.
I didn't want to think, her to think that I was a show-off, you know'

Michael: 'Yes.'

Anne-Marie: 'oh I have fun with men all the time, chasing them and that.'

Michael: 'Mm mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'In my dreams!
And er er'

Anne-Marie: 'she, she said to me on the way o, er as I was I said look I'm going to scoot now and she said well I hope you don't get any unwanted company on the way back.
And I really felt on edge walking back to'

Gearoid: 'Mm mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'the tube station cos I expected him to spring out'

Michael: 'Well, that's my point you see.'

Anne-Marie: 'from erm, an alleyway or'

Rachel: 'But that man does live near you that can give you a lift.'

Anne-Marie: 'I know, but then I, I'd have'

Gearoid: 'Yeah but you'd also have'

Anne-Marie: 'to endure the pub with the other with Don.'

Rachel: 'I know.'

Michael: 'Well I think the next time you just I mean, go home by yourself next time, you know if there was a [UNK] I think you've got to make a point of of you know, not being alone with'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Michael: 'somebody like that around.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'He's obviously obsessive.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm!'

Michael: 'He's not listened to a word you've said.'

Rachel: 'See he's been married before'

Anne-Marie: 'He said to me'

Rachel: 'as well.
I mean'

Anne-Marie: 'he said to me on the train to Richmond'

Anne-Marie: 'erm'

Gearoid: 'Stop!'

Anne-Marie: 'there may well be someone in, in the wings but that's irrelevant to me.
I'll ignore that, I'm in with a chance.'

Michael: '[UNK].'

Rachel: 'I think if you feel like that'

Anne-Marie: 'Well there's no way, no way of there being'

Rachel: 'what's his excuse?'

Michael: 'Yes.
Ya.'

Rachel: 'Cos he, he's being rude to you.
He has totally insulted you.
So I wouldn't feel at all embarrassed.
I mean, sod the choir!
Okay, you're in the same choir'

Gearoid: 'Sod the choir!'

Rachel: 'but he doesn't own it.'

Gearoid: 'Plenty of choirs.'

Rachel: 'He's not going to get you kicked out of the choir.
If anything, he should be kicked out if he's like that.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Rachel: 'Any new girl that comes along is gonna get him leching after her.'

Michael: 'Who's the choir leader?'

Anne-Marie: 'Er th, we have a conductor called Andy [UNK], who is our guest conductor.'

Gearoid: 'Alright.'

Michael: 'But is there nobody like erm'

Michael: 'you know like an orchestra leader?
There isn't er, there isn't somebody who's sort of responsible for coordinating the choir, the choir leaders?'

Anne-Marie: 'There's a chairman.
Bu, you know there's a committee with a chairman.
But we all get changed in the same room when we're at concerts.
And he's [UNK].'

Michael: 'What, men and women together?'

Anne-Marie: 'Yes!
I know, I was appalled that Saturday.'

Gearoid: 'Oh God!'

Anne-Marie: 'And obviously'

Michael: 'The only other'

Anne-Marie: 'maybe I'm misjudging but maybe he was observing.'

Anne-Marie: 'I feel totally embarrassed.
I feel awful!'

Gearoid: 'God they've got'

Rachel: 'I, you're too polite though.
I wouldn't be as polite as you are.'

Gearoid: 'Just tell him to bugger off!'

Rachel: 'Yeah I would've done too.'

Gearoid: 'Get one of those erm attack'

Rachel: 'Rape alarm'

Gearoid: 'Rape'

Rachel: 'things, yeah.'

Gearoid: 'rape alarms.'

Rachel: 'And just bleep that when he comes near you.'

Gearoid: 'Yes.
Absolutely.
Honestly!'

Rachel: 'Rape!'

Gearoid: 'Yeah.
Honestly!'

Rachel: 'Attempted rape!'

Gearoid: 'You know, if he starts creating a scene then you say that retched thing has gone off again in my bag.'

Gearoid: 'You know, d'ya know what I mean?
Just startle him.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Gearoid: 'Cos then you're not going to be [UNK]'

Rachel: 'Cos if he's not being put off by a boyfriend which most men would.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Gearoid: 'Well if needs'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm!'

Michael: 'be, I mean I Gearoid will turn up.'

Anne-Marie: 'Gearoid.
Are you nominating?'

Gearoid: 'And I'll play the boyfriend.'

Anne-Marie: 'He's nominated Gearoid.'

Gearoid: 'I'll leave my handbag at home.'

Michael: 'Or I'll, or I'll turn up'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh God!
No it's really sweet of you'

Rachel: 'No what, perhaps what you should do is'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Rachel: 'one of you should go and pick her up'

Michael: 'That's what I'm saying.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Rachel: 'from the choir one night and you can say to him oh my boyfriend's picking me up and then see how [UNK].'

Gearoid: 'Or you, bring me over and introduce me.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Gearoid: 'And I'll say'

Gearoid: 'you know, I'll say thank you for taking Anna-Marie to, to the Mozart concert.'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'I'll have to do it'

Gearoid: 'But I think she was very [UNK].'

Michael: 'It was really, it was really, it was really very helpful to her at her choir and her practice that night.'

Michael: 'Er erm'

Anne-Marie: 'Yes, cos I'm gonna have to make up some'

Anne-Marie: 'rubbish about'

Gearoid: 'Seeing him.'

Anne-Marie: 'see my boyfriend isn't too interested in concerts'

Anne-Marie: 'and that's why I've enjoyed coming out this evening.'

Gearoid: 'And here, here am I, and then I'll say you know of course I you know I'm indebted to you because I realize that, you know, Anna-Marie is quite prepared to go out with other men if she wants to'

Gearoid: 'but I like [UNK] and make sure it's alright.'

Gearoid: 'I'm actually going to join in the choir.'

Michael: 'You'll be able to take her [UNK]'

Gearoid: 'I can't even have a'

Gearoid: '[UNK].'

Gearoid: 'Anna-Marie's told me so much about it.'

Anne-Marie: 'And can you tell me the ta, time of trains from [UNK].'

Michael: 'Yum yum, look, come on over here.'

Anne-Marie: 'And that's what he was like on Wednesday night, he said look'

Anne-Marie: 'as so, more or less as soon as he'd said hello he said erm thirty two and two minutes past the hour, they're your trains.
I checked them up.
So I thought I couldn't even say'

Anne-Marie: 'look'

Rachel: 'Why?'

Anne-Marie: '[UNK] at one like ten past.
But he didn't [UNK].'

Michael: 'Well, I would go along and'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'pick you up and meet you one evening.'

Anne-Marie: 'That's very sweet of you Michael.
I must say you'

Michael: 'He doesn't know where you've told him you're going to be does he?'

Rachel: 'No, don't ever tell'

Anne-Marie: 'No.'

Rachel: 'them.
And that's something'

Anne-Marie: 'No.'

Rachel: 'Christine said.
Thank God he doesn't know where she lives here cos he'll be round knocking on the door.'

Anne-Marie: 'I know, but the appalling thing is that the address list was given out at the A G M and Christine's phone number is on it.
Cos Rachel rang me at work and said I need your phone number.
I've been fobbing her off saying, I haven't got anywhere permanent.
She said, I need your home number.'

Rachel: 'Well you'll just have to change it when you leave.
Give them, give them Hazlemere number or something.'

Michael: 'Isn't that too far?'

Rachel: 'Mm mm.'

Gearoid: 'Sorry er i'

Gearoid: 'but who was that, who was that list handed round to?'

Anne-Marie: 'To everyone in the choir presumably.'

Gearoid: 'Oh that's dreadful!'

Rachel: 'Oh God!
So you really'

Anne-Marie: 'Don't you'

Anne-Marie: 'tell Christine that.
Cos she actually said to me, thank God we're not gonna have him bothering us.
Well I thought'

Michael: 'Don't erm'

Anne-Marie: 'I'll have to say I'm Rachel because our voices sound the same.'

Rachel: 'Yeah well just don't let Christine know.
Just'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Rachel: 'just say that'

Michael: 'Don't erm that's very bazaar don't you'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Michael: 'think?'

Rachel: 'I think, I think that's, I'

Michael: 'Phone numbers handed out.'

Rachel: 'no I don't think that's on.
Because if you had, I don't think Christine's even got her number in the book.'

Anne-Marie: 'He's got my work number.'

Rachel: 'So that's issuing someone's number.'

Michael: 'Oh yeah.'

Rachel: 'You know'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Michael: 'An ex-directory one.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Rachel: 'I mean it's one thing letting the committee know for their records or something.'

Gearoid: 'Don't tell them you have one.'

Rachel: 'But not just for the'

Anne-Marie: 'Well that's it, I gave it'

Gearoid: 'Just say you don't have the telephone.'

Anne-Marie: 'out.'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Gearoid: 'Yes, but when you move to Fulham.'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh!'

Gearoid: 'I've just moved into a new flat, I don't have a telephone.'

Rachel: 'Yeah.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Gearoid: 'And stick to it.'

Anne-Marie: 'Yes.
And say the other one isn't valid now.'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'Well just give your work number.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Rachel: 'I think that's fine if you give them your work number.'

Anne-Marie: 'That's what'

Gearoid: 'Yes but what about work?'

Anne-Marie: 'I've given.'

Rachel: 'I mean you're there five days a week.'

Anne-Marie: 'I know that's what I've given.
Mm mm.
I'm delaying you now am I?'

Michael: 'You're not.'

Rachel: 'I thought that meal was so delicious!'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Rachel: 'This gravy is delicious as well!'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Michael: 'Do you like it?'

Rachel: 'Mm mm.'

Michael: 'Took me thirty seconds to make that gravy.'

Rachel: 'So what's that made out of?'

Gearoid: 'Booze.'

Michael: 'I chose the booze'

Rachel: 'And has it got alcohol in it?'

Michael: 'It has.'

Rachel: 'I wondered whether it had.'

Michael: 'Erm it's made from Bisto, this instant'

Rachel: 'Mm mm.'

Michael: 'granules.'

Gearoid: 'You'd never believe that would you?'

Anne-Marie: 'No.'

Michael: 'Chicken variety.
With'

Rachel: 'Oh right.'

Michael: 'er two tablespoons of Madeira'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh lovely!'

Rachel: 'Lovely!'

Michael: 'and some redcurrant and port jelly.'

Rachel: 'Mm mm!'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.
It's absolutely delicious!'

Gearoid: 'Well [UNK] we've nothing to mop it up with.'

Michael: 'Dab it behind the ears.'

Anne-Marie: 'I'm gonna get Yum Yum to clear mine off.'

Michael: 'It's good that bottle of gravy.
You'd never know it.'

Rachel: 'No that's great.'

Michael: 'Little trick I learnt years'

Rachel: 'Cos that's nice.
Chris does one actually.'

Michael: 'years and years and years ago.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Michael: 'And you can vary it though, if you're having lamb by putting some mint jelly.'

Anne-Marie: 'Delicious!'

Rachel: 'Well I certainly wouldn't worry about being rude to that to Don the train spotter.'

Gearoid: 'No, I think there's some people you have to be very blunt to.'

Michael: 'Donald [UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.
Don [UNK].'

Gearoid: 'He's, he's an obsessive person.'

Rachel: 'I think his mummy and daddy were poor. [UNK]'

Anne-Marie: 'Did he tell you?'

Rachel: 'being a train spotter.'

Anne-Marie: 'Who?'

Rachel: 'You did.'

Anne-Marie: 'Who?
No, I thought, I thought you meant you'd spoken to him after my date.'

Rachel: 'No, they were on [UNK] before you went on your date.'

Rachel: 'Left mine afterwards.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.
No he's very odd.
Cos I did'

Rachel: 'Does he friends within the choir?'

Anne-Marie: 'I did more or less ignore on the tube journey and the walk to the choir that evening, I mean'

Gearoid: 'Mm mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'I'm very aware of'

Gearoid: 'Not encouraging him.'

Anne-Marie: 'Yes.
So, I I didn't er, I didn't instigate a conversation at all.'

Michael: 'But it sounds as though he doesn't realize that.'

Anne-Marie: 'I didn't ask him whether he got back'

Rachel: 'But some people are so'

Anne-Marie: 'alright, I didn't I answered in monosyllables.'

Gearoid: 'Mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'I didn't instigate a conversation.
And then I ran out after the'

Rachel: 'But he probably couldn't believe his luck that he was going out with you that night.'

Anne-Marie: 'He said I couldn't believe you said'

Rachel: 'I mean what happened erm'

Anne-Marie: 'yes straightaway.
I was thinking'

Rachel: 'How's that?'

Anne-Marie: 'that's because of the Mozart, not you.'

Rachel: 'In highlighted pen that you know so when he goes out with someone in ninete, in two thousand he'll say to someone the last time I went out with someone was in nineteen ninety three.'

Anne-Marie: 'It's sad isn't it?
But I felt sorry for him, I did, but that was my immediate reaction that'

Gearoid: 'Has he got a good voice?'

Anne-Marie: 'Yes.'

Gearoid: 'He's a good singer?'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.
He is.'

Rachel: 'Well he's obviously musical if he's involved in E M I as well.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.
But he can be, he's very, perhaps a bit bossy in it, and erm may, maybe bitter I feel.'

Gearoid: 'Doesn't have a very good sense of humour.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Gearoid: 'I don't think anybody should go out with someone on their own in the beginning, I really don't.'

Anne-Marie: 'Do you not, Gearoid.'

Gearoid: 'No.'

Michael: 'Not nowadays.'

Gearoid: 'I don't care what anybody says.
Whether it's two'

Michael: 'Yeah.'

Gearoid: 'guys or two women'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Gearoid: 'or anything, I really don't think anyone should put themselves in that position.
You're better off going out as a threesome or a foursome'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.'

Rachel: 'Yeah but if you get asked out'

Gearoid: 'but until you'

Rachel: 'for a date, you're not going to say can I bring my friend?'

Gearoid: 'By a total stranger?'

Rachel: 'Well I suppose I wouldn't do that with a total stranger.'

Gearoid: 'She did.'

Anne-Marie: 'I know, but a stra, what do you mean, what do you classify as a stranger?'

Gearoid: 'Someone you don't know'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.'

Gearoid: 'anything about.'

Anne-Marie: 'I know that they're they're'

Gearoid: 'Because I go out'

Anne-Marie: 'they're involved in the ca'

Gearoid: 'if'

Anne-Marie: 'in the, erm the choir.'

Gearoid: 'Just because you work with the guy'

Michael: 'But you've never had a conversation with him.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Gearoid: 'Just because you know the guy from Marks and Spencers.'

Rachel: 'I did that with Graham.
I went out, I hadn't even I'd said hello to him, that was it.'

Gearoid: 'You see, I think that's really strange in this day and age.'

Anne-Marie: 'Yes but you're meeting in a public place.
Not like, I mean I was making my way there, he was making his way there and I wouldn't want them to come and pick me up in the car'

Gearoid: 'Mm mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'and me go off, I wouldn't do that without really you know, having been out with him a few times.
But I'd make'

Gearoid: 'Good.'

Anne-Marie: 'my own way there and meet them.
In a public place.
But if I met, but then that's slightly different because if I met someone in a nightclub or something like that then I would be quite wary.'

Gearoid: 'Mm mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'I don't think I'd I don't know I don't know what I'd do.
I'd feel quite differently.
But something like the choir or where you've been working, I don't know you, I, I've got this thing which is'

Gearoid: 'Well I still'

Anne-Marie: 'I think'

Gearoid: 'think'

Anne-Marie: 'you, you know you feel safe [UNK].'

Gearoid: 'that even in something like the choir it's somebody that you should of struck up a, er a relationship you know, over several'

Michael: 'The'

Gearoid: 'intervals.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'Yeah.'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.'

Gearoid: 'And you suddenly, you thought to yourself well you know I actually quite like this chap.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Gearoid: 'You know, wouldn't it be nice if he had asked me out.
And then suddenly the day'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Gearoid: 'comes along.
Not to sort of well you, you can't be blamed because I mean yo, in the innocent you were actually going because of the concert.'

Anne-Marie: 'I know.
You see I ne'

Gearoid: 'But he didn't, you know, he, he can't believe his luck that somebody'

Anne-Marie: 'No.'

Gearoid: 'as attractive as you'

Gearoid: 'said yes [UNK]'

Gearoid: 'he's got this goat beard and this hairy bottom lip!'

Gearoid: 'You know, breathe that smells of moth balls, I mean who would have thought of that.'

Michael: 'And he, and'

Gearoid: 'If he were taking several of you out why didn't you say to one of the other girls why don't you come?
Did he have a pair of tickets?'

Anne-Marie: 'Cos it was when we were walking down'

## 131702

Rachel: 'Michael can I have a look please?'

Michael: 'Oh sorry!'

Rachel: 'Thank you.'

Gearoid: 'Oh sorry.'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh gross!'

Anne-Marie: 'The heel and everything's lovely isn't'

Gearoid: 'Yeah.'

Rachel: 'And we haven't got a clue.'

Anne-Marie: 'See you've done very well knocking those together.'

Gearoid: 'Think nothing of it.'

Gearoid: 'Neither do we.
Haphazard.

Michael: 'cake.'

Anne-Marie: 'Sorry.'

Michael: 'Oh sorry, sorry, sorry!'

Gearoid: 'Oh well please calm down.'

Gearoid: 'Just grab the knife up over head and down at the table.'

Gearoid: 'This is a very timely supper.'

Gearoid: 'You were tempted to take a knife out of?'

Rachel: 'I didn't have time.
Michael was asking about my menswear.
But he'd be made-to-measure.'

Anne-Marie: 'But he didn't have any did he?'

Rachel: 'Waistcoats.'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh no!'

Gearoid: 'I remember we saw in the other shop [UNK] It happened again.'

Anne-Marie: 'Do you have any use for your French jacket at all?'

Rachel: 'When did you buy some jackets in France?'

Anne-Marie: 'He [UNK].'

Gearoid: 'And then we got know the [UNK] go and get myself out of Marks and Spencers this weekend which for menswear particularly it was very dowdy [UNK].
And, and we [UNK].'

Rachel: 'Snobs!'

Gearoid: 'Unlike your shoes Rachel, it's glossed out. [UNK]'

Rachel: 'No.'

Michael: 'Oh dear.'

Anne-Marie: 'Was that in the sale, or that was the normal price?'

Michael: 'In the sale.'

Gearoid: 'I've never seen this gentleman [UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'Really?
Twenty five pounds is very good.'

Michael: 'Don't you want some more milk?'

Anne-Marie: 'No.'

Gearoid: 'No we'll just pocket the money.'

Anne-Marie: 'But you said that they buy'

Rachel: 'Yes, but they sell, you can buy'

Gearoid: 'I doubt it.'

Rachel: 'articles, but they sell them back again.'

Anne-Marie: 'No thank you.
No thank you.'

Michael: 'Sure?'

Anne-Marie: 'No I'm alright.'

Michael: 'Okay.'

Rachel: 'But then they se, you see they sell those in their staff shop.'

Gearoid: 'But'

Gearoid: 'I thought it was meant to be anonymous.'

Michael: 'It's up to a point.'

Anne-Marie: 'Tell us about your job.'

Michael: 'I can't stand it!'

Michael: 'Aye well'

Anne-Marie: 'Whose, whose mother did you see this morning?'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Gearoid: 'Why have you just tipped cream on that? [UNK] in Cornwall.
Not indeed, I recognise it.
The Royal Albert Hall.
[UNK] [UNK] Th the commissionaires on the doorway.
But will they be defending [UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.'

Michael: 'That is a West Sussex term.'

Gearoid: 'Been teaching it to Hazlemere.'

Gearoid: 'Keep your hands close to the [UNK] dish now Michael.'

Michael: 'And we just [UNK].'

Gearoid: 'Getting Michael giggly.'

Rachel: 'No Red Rock's come back.'

Gearoid: 'I just wondered if you'd rather'

Gearoid: 'pay it back.'

Michael: 'It is on.'

Michael: 'Isn't it?'

Gearoid: 'Testing, testing, testing.'

Anne-Marie: 'You're not supposed to know.'

Michael: 'Oh my, I'm not supposed to see.'

Gearoid: 'Switch it off now for a few minutes.'

Rachel: 'Okay?
Ah ah!
I'll leave you with that.'

Michael: 'The [UNK] worm.'

Gearoid: 'Look at these flowers!'

Rachel: 'So these are lovely!'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'Five cheesies to one slurp of drink.'

Michael: 'Hmm mm.'

Gearoid: 'Why is it pure gin?'

Gearoid: 'I think Ted would be proud of me.'

Anne-Marie: 'Well, my stars say if you find yourself at a low ebb this weekend don't worry.
Every so often we all need to wind down.'

Gearoid: 'There you are.'

Anne-Marie: 'If your a little numb, cynical, or apathetic it's probably a healthy sign.
It simply means you're in the process of recharging your batteries and reassessing your priorities.'

Michael: 'Well Anna-Marie is there something you want to tell us?'

Michael: 'I'm Cancer.
What does it say about me.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.
Market forces do not make the world go round.
The earth does not spin on its axis for profit, the sun does not shine because it happens to have shares in a household firm.
If any force guides the universe, universe, it surely must be love.
In allowing yourself to be led now by the same illogical but kind motive, you are not being as silly as you think.
Indeed, the more selfless you can be this weekend, the better things will work out'

Rachel: 'Oh how nice.
That sounds good to me.'

Rachel: 'What's Virgo?'

Michael: 'Better [UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'It doesn't make sense to buy the cheapest brand of baked beans to save a few pence.'

Gearoid: 'It's true.'

Anne-Marie: 'So then fill your car tank at the most expensive petrol station in town.'

Anne-Marie: 'If you're going to make economies, make efficient ones.
Similarly, if you are going to be extravagant, be so in an a area, where you're actually going to see the benefit'

Gearoid: 'So you see'

Anne-Marie: 'Ha'

Gearoid: 'I told you you should have those two pairs of shoes.'

Anne-Marie: 'happiness will come to all Virgos who aim the right arrows at the right targets this weekend.
Gearoid, what are you?'

Gearoid: 'It depends.
It is the nineteenth of February, which one does it fall on theirs?
Pisces or Aquarius?'

Rachel: 'Pisces.'

Anne-Marie: 'Aquaria, Aquarius.'

Gearoid: 'Mhm.'

Anne-Marie: 'Expect a hectic weekend.'

Gearoid: 'Hmm mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'You will have to spend a lot of time preventing tricky scenarios from getting any worse or keeping antagonistic individuals apart.'

Michael: 'Who was that.'

Anne-Marie: 'Simultaneously, you may be fending off criticism from a friend or relative who feels'

Gearoid: 'Ah oh!
Aha.
Yes.'

Anne-Marie: 'who feels your, your plans are not in their best interest.'

Gearoid: 'Well'

Michael: 'So naff off!'

Anne-Marie: 'You can though perform a successful damage limitation exercise if you try.
You may even be able to coax a victory out of the situation.'

Michael: 'That's Gearoid for you.'

Anne-Marie: 'But if you attend church'

Gearoid: 'I love this ad.'

Anne-Marie: 'Tea!
Coffee!'

Rachel: 'What?'

Michael: 'I shouldn't be so lazy.'

Anne-Marie: 'Well we are.'

Michael: 'I know but there's a lot of food coming out now.'

Rachel: 'I can't believe how strong'

Anne-Marie: 'Is there?'

Rachel: 'these are.'

Gearoid: 'It's good though.
I can feel the backs of my eyes warming now.'

Rachel: 'I can feel my'

Gearoid: 'Thingamajig.'

Rachel: 'Yeah.'

Anne-Marie: 'Your cheek.'

Gearoid: 'whatever they call that.'

Rachel: 'My cheek, yeah.'

Rachel: 'The back of my throat.'

Gearoid: 'Mm mm.'

Rachel: 'Last time I saw this was in'

Anne-Marie: 'Who is that?'

Gearoid: 'This?'

Rachel: 'erm Blind Date.
Clara B seems to live in fear of me appearing on there one evening.
Her tuning in and watching.'

Michael: 'Probably you will.'

Anne-Marie: 'You're joking?'

Rachel: 'They interviewed, interview you to get on there anyway.
The one thing that really, apar, well not the one thing, many things irritate me about the programme, but one of them is that they get people on so you've got someone choosing who lives in Edinburgh choosing someone who lives down in Plymouth'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Rachel: 'you know, amongst someone else who's from you know Wales or something.'

Michael: 'Mm mm.'

Rachel: 'I mean it's so silly!'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'Well'

Rachel: 'They should all have them from a similar area because most of the time they say oh well they live so far away'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Rachel: 'you know.'

Anne-Marie: 'I don't like it when they're horrid to each other.'

Rachel: 'Well there was a big row, and I thought it was going to get really nasty.
They were so horrendous to each other.'

Gearoid: 'I think I might have sawn that.
Yeah.'

Rachel: 'She was just absolutely appalling!'

Gearoid: 'She was dreadful wasn't she?'

Rachel: 'Oh!
She was so conceited.'

Gearoid: 'Let's see yous.
What are you wearing?'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh I don't like is she showing her tummy?'

Rachel: 'She is isn't she?'

Anne-Marie: 'No!
Must be a belt.
Is it?'

Gearoid: 'Yes, it's a belt.'

Rachel: 'Well actually, at least she's wearing decent colours.'

Gearoid: 'She's pulled her hair back off her'

Anne-Marie: 'She has hasn't she?
I mean that outfit's not a bad one for her really is it?
For her.
Better than some of them.'

Rachel: 'I don't really like the short sleeves.'

Gearoid: 'No.'

Anne-Marie: 'I know but some of the things she wears are so awful!'

Rachel: 'Oh yeah.'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh what's he got between his legs?
Oh [UNK].'

Gearoid: 'Probably black knickers.'

Anne-Marie: 'Look how much she's got on.'

Anne-Marie: 'But you have to look at th, his trousers, the last man.
So he's from Bournemouth.
Oh.
He was'

Gearoid: 'Here!
Come here.'

Michael: 'Mm mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'Don't you want one?'

Rachel: 'Look at her thighs.
They're really big aren't they?'

Michael: 'Mm mm.'

Gearoid: 'Oh look at that.'

Rachel: 'Do you see'

Gearoid: 'Yes.'

Rachel: 'what I mean?'

Gearoid: 'Look at the trousers.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Rachel: 'I am about to fall asleep.
Cos my life's so interesting.'

Anne-Marie: 'He's probably nervous.'

Rachel: 'Mm mm.'

Michael: 'No.

Gearoid: 'You'd think he was entitled to living with us too you know.'

Anne-Marie: 'Yum Yum.'

Anne-Marie: 'Yum Yum.
Yum Yum.

Michael: 'Come on. [UNK]'

Anne-Marie: 'There you see.
Thank you.'

Gearoid: 'The awful thing is, he'll terrorize the other one.'

Anne-Marie: 'No that was stop you doing that.'

Rachel: 'He wasn't even half way down and he was growling.
Poor old Cilla.'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh he's awful.
He gives me the creeps.'

Gearoid: 'Just in case he's got these [UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm mm.'

Rachel: 'Yuk!
Yuk!'

Anne-Marie: 'What an absolute jerk!'

Rachel: 'Are you really?'

Michael: 'Jolly hockey sticks!
Oh ya!'

Rachel: 'Oh God!
Mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'But he's got quite an old face for'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'his body.
He can only take certain size steps though.
He couldn't run.'

Rachel: 'He's'

Anne-Marie: 'Peculiar.
Shrieks [UNK].'

Rachel: 'No!
Yum Yum.'

Anne-Marie: 'Wo!'

Rachel: 'Come on here.'

Gearoid: 'Good boy.

Rachel: 'Is that what you'

Gearoid: 'Lie down.'

Rachel: 'do now [UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'What say that'

Gearoid: 'Yep.'

Anne-Marie: 'to Yum yum.'

Rachel: 'What?
The woman's going to be quite posh.'

Anne-Marie: 'She'll probably be as nutty as hell and come from West Yorkshire or something.'

Gearoid: 'I think Cilla doesn't photograph well.
She's not photogenic.'

Rachel: 'There is a lovely photo of her of the back of her C D's.'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh look what she's'

Gearoid: 'Ya, but it's'

Anne-Marie: 'wearing!'

Gearoid: 'She looks older than my mother.'

Michael: 'Mm.'

Rachel: 'Yeah.'

Anne-Marie: 'What did you say Gearoid?
A student?'

Anne-Marie: 'Well she could be my age and be a student.
She sounds awful!'

Michael: 'Well, yeah, I was gonna say mutton dressed as lamb.'

Anne-Marie: '[UNK].'

Rachel: 'Well that would have worn off.'

Gearoid: 'What is she studying?'

Anne-Marie: 'History.
I mean she could be twenty five.
I mean'

Gearoid: 'Historical figure.'

Michael: 'Oh God!
I've got to do the washing up?'

Rachel: 'Shall I, shall I come and help you?'

Michael: 'Only when you're drunk.
Only when you're coming to refill.'

Rachel: 'No, I'll come now.
What do you want me to do?'

Gearoid: 'Sit there.'

Rachel: 'Are you sure?'

Rachel: 'I think Gearoid should'

Michael: 'You're enjoying yourself.'

Rachel: 'be doing the cooking because he's the only sober one.'

Rachel: 'Hello.'

Anne-Marie: 'Well that's just, he's just sad really isn't he?
Oh no!
He's what The Roman version of [UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'He's funny isn't he, number one?
Excuse you.
I think they'd be, they'd be quite well suited.'

Rachel: 'Mm mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'She certainly wouldn't like that number three.'

Rachel: 'I think he's quite nice.'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.
But he's not really coming out with the answers.'

Anne-Marie: 'What did you say?'

Gearoid: 'Got jug ears this one.'

Rachel: 'Are you gonna sing it?'

Anne-Marie: 'She's very broad shouldered.'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'Isn't she?'

Anne-Marie: 'Oh no!'

Rachel: 'Oh no!'

Anne-Marie: 'Michael, she's chosen number three.'

Michael: 'You're kidding?'

Anne-Marie: 'She's going to die when she sees him.'

Rachel: 'Oh oh!'

Michael: 'What was, what was the audience reactions?'

Anne-Marie: 'I think shock.

Michael: 'Mhm.'

Rachel: 'I went to see it at the Barbican, it's very good.'

Michael: 'How much of Shakespeare do you have to do or do you have to do it all?
You can't possibly have to do it all do you?'

Anne-Marie: 'We're doing Twelfth Night and the Winter's Tale this semester.'

Michael: '[UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'And we did Hamlet and King Lear last year.'

The ones I really liked that we did last year were the erm we did Great Expectations.'

Michael: 'Mm?'

Anne-Marie: 'But I'll drop my English after Christmas.
I do my exam in January and then I drop it because I go on a teaching practice and I pick it up halfway through third year.'

Rachel: 'Oh really [UNK]'

Michael: 'How much teaching practice do you have to do?'

Anne-Marie: 'I've got odd days and then a six week block.'

Michael: 'And do you know where you're having that teaching practice?'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm in Guildford.'

Michael: 'Oh that's right, you said yes.'

Anne-Marie: 'It's next door to my old middle school, it's where a lot of my friends went.'

Michael: 'Are any of your friends teaching?'

Anne-Marie: 'There?'

Michael: 'Or in the teaching profession [UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'No.'

Michael: 'Will you be a good teacher?'

Anne-Marie: 'Pardon?'

I think it's in the blood though isn't it with our family.'

Michael: 'Yeah there's a lot of teachers [UNK].'

Gearoid: '[UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'Yes and erm [UNK] side as well.
Daddy's side has got his cousins, two of his cousins are teachers, his sister's a teacher.
Apparently his mother taught, that's how she met [UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'I don't know if I'd want to stay in teaching, I'd quite like to have my own nursery school.
But what I'd do is I'd I'd do it from hours something like eight until six and I'd give them a cooked lunch all fresh food'

Michael: 'Mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'and after say three o'clock in the afternoon they'd do activities, work connected with'

Michael: 'School.'

Anne-Marie: 'school.'

Michael: 'Joy-riding, mugging.'

Anne-Marie: 'Yes.'

Rachel: 'Yes.'

Michael: '[UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'If you g if you attend a nursery school, you're less likely to fall into criminal ways than if you haven't attended a nursery school.'

Michael: 'Why's that?'

Rachel: 'I've never heard that before.'

Anne-Marie: 'It's a fact.'

Michael: '[UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'It's according to satist to statistics and studies carried out.'

Michael: 'But what's the reasoning behind that.'

Anne-Marie: 'The reasoning behind that is that [UNK] come from a lower class generally if you can't you know you can't go to a nursery school cos you have to pay for nursery school education in this country.
And you don't actually start learning how to how to structure and do things in your leisure time.
Cos at nursery school it's basically it is leisure.'

Michael: 'Mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'Pursuits that you're doing.
You see if you if you haven't been introduced to those when you're young.'

Michael: 'At an early age.'

Anne-Marie: 'It's actually and that's the most absorbent time, your mind's most absorbent where you're up to the age of five which is when you should when you're at nursery school.
And if you come from a family that don't bother and they haven't got the time to show you how to do things, or do things with you, and don't send you to a nursery school then you start you know just I suppose like what they do is [UNK].'

Michael: 'Well I think the attitude is and maybe I'm totally wrong [UNK] the attitude is that if they're outside, they're not creating mess and havoc in the house.'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'Mm.'

Michael: '[UNK] sort of turn a blind eye.'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'You don't remember'

Anne-Marie: 'What were their names?'

Rachel: '[UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'I can't say I remember that one.'

Rachel: 'And I'm afraid I don't know the other brother's name.'

Michael: 'I think you'd be inclined to remember that name.'

Rachel: 'Well I was little red riding hood'

Anne-Marie: 'I know.'

Rachel: 'in our production.'

Rachel: 'I would have thought that would have been your cup of tea.'

Gearoid: '[UNK].

Rachel: 'Sorry.'

Gearoid: 'Very inaccessible [UNK] it seemed to me.'

Rachel: 'Well you have to travel by car to the station.'

Gearoid: 'Oh it seemed to be a terrible drive.'

Rachel: 'Well you just turn off the A three at [UNK] instead of.'

Michael: 'We just weren't used to driving in the country then, it seemed like a long way from'

Gearoid: 'So we're down to Guildford but not through Guildford.'

Rachel: 'No not Guildford, you carry on the A three'

Michael: 'Further on.
Much further on.'

Rachel: 'Further on.
Much further on.
And you instead of taking the instead of going as far as the [UNK] traffic lights to come to us, you take the [UNK] exit before that which is [UNK]'

Michael: 'Mm.'

Rachel: 'and you just go down through there and you come into [UNK].
It's not I wouldn't say'

Gearoid: '[UNK] very very [UNK].'

Gearoid: 'It's ridiculous.

Rachel: 'Really you've noticed the difference?'

Michael: 'We're spending the money now on the cottage and things like that but it just makes it just makes you think what we were frittering away.'

Rachel: 'Yeah.'

Michael: 'And we'd go to the theatre or but I mean we do all that sort of thing still but we just have to cram it into the week.'

Rachel: 'Where did you get all the beads from?'

Gearoid: '[UNK] in Paris.'

Rachel: 'Oh she used to live up there did she?'

Michael: 'Mm.

Quite a rustic'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'way of life.
[UNK] rustic Yorkshire [UNK].
And while he was on the film set or wherever he was you know, away from home for the week, he'd be playing around with every bit of skirt he could find.'

Michael: 'But I think she's doing a good job of bringing Thomas up I must say. [UNK].'

Gearoid: 'She certainly doesn't [UNK] any kind of handicap or a stigma.'

Rachel: 'Good.'

Gearoid: '[UNK] which is good.'

Rachel: '[UNK] it's young for her I mean'

Michael: 'And she's got him into a very good er nursery school apparently.

Rachel: 'I was thinking it [UNK] another room [UNK] bigger.'

Michael: 'It's it's about half the size again.'

Rachel: 'If you if you did get [UNK] how would how would'

Michael: 'We'd have to keep'

Rachel: 'you do it?'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Anne-Marie: 'But that's no bad thing, if you ever wanted to sell it.'

Michael: 'Erm'

Anne-Marie: '[UNK].'

Michael: 'Just knock through here.
I mean the whole thing would have to be redesigned.'

Rachel: 'So you wouldn't knock upstairs cos you'd have two staircases wouldn't you?'

Anne-Marie: 'I quite like that actually.'

Gearoid: 'Sally has two staircases.'

Michael: 'It's not unusual.'

Michael: 'What yo you would have to do a a lot of remodelling downstairs because t there's no point having two kitchens.
But if we had the accommodation downstairs, you we could ea easily have a good sitting room that we never use.
Have it there for show.'

Rachel: 'Is that the way they've done it or'

Michael: 'It is very [UNK]'

Rachel: 'What does that what do you what do you mean?
Their furniture their furnishings.'

Michael: 'It's very white [UNK].'

Rachel: 'Oh is it.'

Michael: 'Yeah it's all it's very stark.'

Rachel: 'So it's not kind of country cottage style.'

Michael: 'No she has a couple of nice pieces though.'

Michael: 'Erm wi if you had the accommodation of both houses downstairs, you'd have you'd easily have a good size sitting room.
You'd have a d a separate dining room.'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'You'd then maybe have like a little library [UNK].'

Anne-Marie: 'Yeah.'

Michael: 'And and a good size kitchen breakfast room.
You'd actually have quite a lot of accommodation downstairs.'

Rachel: 'Mm and four bedrooms.'

Michael: 'And four bedrooms.'

Michael: 'You see we'd get rid rid of one bathroom, in fact I'd maybe be tempted to put a bathroom upstairs [UNK].
It could be en suite.'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'With like a dressing room [UNK].'

Anne-Marie: '[UNK] isn't there.'

Michael: 'Well er I mean eventually we'd have to think of something [UNK].
But it it's if we don't have that opportunity with next door then [UNK] some years down the line [UNK].'

Rachel: 'But would you consider touring erm retiring here?
I know it's a long way off but you mentioned retirement yesterday.'

Rachel: 'You taking early retirement?'

Michael: 'I've no interest in work.
I loathe work.'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'I just loathe work.
I think life is too short. [UNK]'

Rachel: '[UNK] if you can retire at fifty.'

Michael: 'Well we'd have to divest ourselves of some of our assets.'

Michael: 'I also think there's no point retiring at sixty five you know, aged and decrepit.'

Rachel: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'Probably incontinent and [UNK] you know whatever'

Rachel: 'Mm mm.'

Michael: 'And then you start thinking well you know now I'll see the world.

Rachel: 'Mm yeah.'

Michael: 'And do the things you can.'

Rachel: '[UNK] two years isn't he and he can retire early.'

Anne-Marie: 'He'll be about fifty seven.'

Michael: '[UNK] he could still do work, I mean he could still [UNK]'

Rachel: 'I think he'd want to have some kind of little business going where if he wants to he can go off [UNK] And then he can go off and pick it up and'

Anne-Marie: 'And he does like to travel.'

Rachel: 'I know he is thinking of going to France [UNK].'

Michael: 'Whereabouts?'

Rachel: 'In the middle really isn't it?
He doesn't want to go too far down to the South.'

Gearoid: 'In [UNK] an hour north east of Paris, going towards Belgium.'

Rachel: 'No I think that's too north isn't it.'

Gearoid: 'Yeah.'

Rachel: 'Yeah because our uncle also wants to [UNK] so they didn't know whether they should all go and get [UNK] or whatever I don't know.
But mummy's not very keen.
She wants to be near us.
She wants us to settle down and then she knows where she w where she should be.
And then she can go off.'

Rachel: 'And daddy's doing his advanced French classes [UNK].'

Michael: 'Is he.'

Rachel: 'And he was delighted that he learnt how to say, I'm having a lie-in tomorrow morning.'

Michael: 'Very useful when one is taking early retirement.'

Anne-Marie: 'Is he I didn't know he'd started doing advanced French.'
