Legal threats as well!'

Lisa: 'Yeah, and some days you need to [UNK].'

Melvin: 'Yeah.'

Lisa: 'And er you know put it down in writing because that way Avon will then se see and the, hang on!
What's Quadling playing at here!'

Lisa: 'We're not having that!
Yeah.'

Lisa: 'We're not having this! [UNK]'

Melvin: 'Yeah.'

Lisa: 'And also state that over the years er your father used to run the business done hundreds of jobs for Avon Insurance at, and er also you yourself have done jobs for Avon Insurance before who have never ever had any trouble whatever so ever!
Like er you know, with any of the work we've done'

Melvin: 'No.'

Lisa: 'er it's always been er guaranteed i.e. if a customer was not satisfied, then one hundred percent we will rectify whatever it is they're not satisfied with.'

Lisa: 'Mm.'

Lisa: 'We always maintain that our word is our bond all of our work.
And then to be treated er as out and out er criminals, like this Quadling had done with us is just beyond all bounds of having reasonable'

Lisa: 'Mm.'

Lisa: 'business sense!'

Melvin: 'Yeah.
But wha but when he'd said, turned round and said, oh it's a legal contract!
I'd tell him'

Lisa: 'It's not!'

Melvin: 'to fuck off!'

Lisa: 'Not over the phone.
Spoken as in [UNK] but it's you know'

Melvin: 'You've gotta sign something.'

Lisa: 'I know.'

Lisa: 'But that's intimidation that is, threats'

Melvin: 'That's right.'

Lisa: 'at you.'

Melvin: 'Okay, yes I agreed for the er the price but I said that I haven't seen the work.
I hadn't seen'

Lisa: 'Okay.'

Melvin: 'the job.
I've, I've quoted for the job.'

Lisa: 'That's right.'

Melvin: 'I says okay I'll agree to it but I wanna se, I haven't seen it, so how do I know?'

Lisa: 'Yeah.'

Melvin: 'You know that's what I said to him on the phone!

Oh I told you Mel, did I?'

Melvin: 'Yeah.'

Lisa: 'And ten pounds from the bank!
Cos I was twenty five pence overdrawn!
So I wrote a stinking letter to them!
A one of the one of the sentences, [UNK], how dare you authorise the withdrawal of fifteen pounds from account without prior notification!
Or at least having the decency and good manners to at least let me know what you'd done!'

Lisa: 'Yeah!'

Lisa: 'And er, anyway I got this terrific letter back!
You should, well granddad was there about half an hour reading it!
It was er one foolscap plus of, of words you know, explaining what, what they'd done and all this [UNK] and why they'd done it!'

Lisa: 'They credited you?'

Lisa: 'And yeah, they've gone and re-credited me for the fifteen pound!
Yeah!'

Melvin: 'Yeah.'

Lisa: 'Great!'

Melvin: 'Bit over the top innit?
Fifteen quid for twenty five pence!'

Lisa: 'Well then, no, what it is they've charged for each'

Lisa: 'Yeah.'

Lisa: 'cheque that you'

Lisa: 'Yeah.'

Lisa: 'you do about a quarter.'

Lisa: 'I wouldn't of minded, like I said to the bloke er if he, if I'd been er a hundred pounds overdrawn or fifty quid overdrawn or something like that, I wouldn't of minded so much because I knew'

Melvin: 'Yeah.'

Lisa: 'that I would be overdrawn.'

Lisa: 'Mm.'

Lisa: 'And I'd know that I'd incurred that expense.
But er but a mere twenty pe pence!
I thought, it's an insult my flipping intelligence!'

Melvin: 'Yeah.
That's right.'

Lisa: 'But it was, you know.
Well anyway I got this lovely letter back!'

Lisa: 'Oh well!'

Lisa: 'So letter and er and evening compiling it has er gained me my fifteen pound back!'

Lisa: 'Yeah.'

Lisa: 'No it doesn't hurt to write a few letters.'

Melvin: 'Old bloke came round today.'

Lisa: 'Oh David!
Yes.'

Melvin: 'Cor he did half stink of booze!'

Lisa: 'Oh it's'

Melvin: 'Yeah, apparently he had a row with his Mrs ex-Mrs wife.'

Lisa: 'Yeah.'

Melvin: 'He had a row with his new wife [UNK].'

Lisa: 'So why did he come round and see you?'

Melvin: 'Dunno.'

Lisa: 'Start again on booze!'

Melvin: 'Bought a Volvo, T reg [UNK] forty quid!'

Lisa: 'Did he?
Well if, if he's got an M O T on it he'll be able to run it until the M O T'

Melvin: 'runs out November.'

Lisa: 'runs out.
Oh well he can run until then, then and just take it out to [UNK] and leave it there.'

Melvin: 'He's done it up.'

Lisa: 'Has he?'

Melvin: 'He's doing it up.'

Lisa: 'Yeah.'

Lisa: 'And what are they doing about it, nothing!'

Lisa: 'I reckon it ought to be compulsory that.
Like a car needs to go in for the M O T, you've gotta'

Lisa: 'Mm, you've gotta have your eyes tested.'

Lisa: '[UNK] for your eyes.'

Lisa: 'Yeah.
In Germany you have to carry, if you wear glasses, you have to carry a spare pair of glasses with you!'

Lisa: 'Yeah.
I had to do this in Adelaide you know, when I went for my D S V license.
I had loads of dots in front of me you know, in this machine'

Lisa: 'Colour blind.'

Lisa: 'and er yeah, I had to er tell them what numbers were what er letters'

Lisa: 'Mm.'

Lisa: 'numbers rather were coming, coming up, you know?
And I just ran through them, you know, it was no problem to me.
But I can image yo, yo, you can stand [UNK]'

Lisa: 'You'd fail.'

Lisa: 'doing it.
So and er ooh I had they did er this old butterfly thing as well, the old psychology bit as well, you know.
What does that look like?
You know!
A blob of ink squashed together what else!
You know?'

Lisa: 'Yeah.'

Lisa: 'And er how old?
That was the first time I had to cough for anybody that was, as well.'

Lisa: '[UNK].'

Lisa: 'I didn't particularly like that idea.
Just testing for a hernia, I told I hadn't got one!
Yeah.'

Melvin: 'Ha!'

Lisa: 'It's like that er truck driver that came into your place when er you and er that bloke that used to there.
And a he came in there and er for his glasses and er old [UNK] was having a headache actually [UNK] everything'

Lisa: 'Oh yeah.'

Lisa: 'and he, he was a er said he was nearly enough, near enough blind!'

Lisa: 'Yeah, he didn't need glasses for driving!
You know er!'

Lisa: 'The old, old ones are the worst, I tell you!'

Lisa: 'Yeah.
Well anybody over forty years old it ought to be, it ought to be compulsory!'

Lisa: 'No, my driving's alright ma [UNK]!
But he can't hear nothing about [UNK]!'

Melvin: 'No, he can't actually no!
Except get the cops in.'

Lisa: 'It's a privilege [UNK].
I'll always maintain that people with glasses know they've got something wrong with their eyes so the chances are if they're wearing glasses then they can see properly!'

Melvin: 'Yeah.'

Lisa: 'It's the guy that hasn't got glasses, that's the guy you've gotta worry about.'

Lisa: 'Yeah.'

Melvin: 'That's right.'

Lisa: 'What's the time?
