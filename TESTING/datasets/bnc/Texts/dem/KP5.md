Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'So we, with your pensions and things is mum, what about mum does she know what about the state pension and stuff?'

Catherine: 'Well mum can draw a state pension when she's sixty or something on what I pay in into the scheme so you'

Catherine: 'Oh.'

Catherine: 'get it on one.'

Catherine: 'Because she hasn't worked, nothing?'

Catherine: 'Mm.
Well, so and th, and the husband'

Catherine: 'So married woman's like if their husband left them and they're at work well how do they, how are they covered?
Or are they not?'

Catherine: 'I don't know.
I don't know, it's, it's er it's a little harder to say the least.
Is, if they we, if he's left I suppose she would get the, the single, single person's thing.'

Catherine: 'Oh right.'

Catherine: 'But it's not so much nowadays though.
You have a the problem [UNK] if the husband remarries.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'Er, er, you know, who gets the'

Catherine: 'I suppose it's pretty difficult really.'

Catherine: 'No you can't.
Sorry.
Erm, with mum i i i is fine because she could [UNK] from my point of view so, and also as regards the, if anything happens to me, then she gets a pension from the bank she gets'

Catherine: 'Oh!'

Catherine: 'a widow's pension from the bank'

Catherine: 'Oh right.'

Catherine: 'so that she doesn't so we get nothing for'

Catherine: 'Oh right.
It's quite good to work for a big concern like that then really?'

Catherine: 'Oh yeah.
And of course even that's going to change as time goes on.'

Catherine: 'Really?
So what happens like, with me?
Like teaching?
Do I need to do I, they don't do anything'

Catherine: 'Well you may have, you may have to look after yourself in fact.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
Cos obviously it's different for you.'

Catherine: 'That's the thing.
Erm er it will be see if you can pay into something'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'er soon after you start your job.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
I'll think about it'

Catherine: 'So, say as, say erm, say by the time you're you're probably, mm, I dunno, thirty.'

Catherine: 'Yeah, cos I'll be working well I'm twenty one.
I'm doing a third year I'll be twenty four'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'when I qualify.
Seems sensible to start as soon as possible really.'

Catherine: 'Well you can start off with you see, a small sum as regards an insurance policy.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'Then take the twenty five or thirty years.'

Catherine: 'Is that what you've done?
That's how you're paying?'

Catherine: 'No.
The two, the two insurance policies I had of erm er the house were on [UNK]'

Catherine: 'Oh right.'

Catherine: 'and when we moved I think we had a new insurance policy to cover [UNK] and the others became mine.'

Catherine: 'Oh right.'

Catherine: 'That's why it's very important cos I haven't got my early matured pay from Roberts and the other one in fact matures next year with everything attached to it except for one'

Catherine: 'Oh right.'

Catherine: 'of you, for you.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'And the lump sum I can then could put in mum's name to avoid.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'paying tax on the interest.'

Catherine: 'Oh right.'

Catherine: 'And then just utilize a little each year.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
Oh right.
We should get help with James though shouldn't we?'

Catherine: 'Well at the moment, I'm working on a nil return for'

Catherine: 'Oh.'

Catherine: 'James so, if there is something, all well and good.'

Catherine: 'Oh yeah.
I don't see how they can justify I mean, anybody, unless you'd got mega bucks'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'you're just paying out that amount of money and suddenly in one goes' a big, bi, like quite a shock.
And you might like, on paper, have the money like, by the end of the like, year or whatever but paying it out in one go or'

Catherine: 'Well the thing is they're not gonna get any wind of erm what [UNK] so he's gonna get sacked.
Gone into erm money [UNK].
And that way, any interest on erm it becomes tax free.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
Oh!'

Catherine: 'So again, I have to be careful because real interest is gained on this money that's in grand mama's name.
Or grand mama's account which is in Claire and er Nigel's.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
There's not that much there though is there?'

Catherine: 'There's enough.'

Catherine: 'Really?'

Catherine: 'Yeah, it's erm'

Catherine: '[UNK] Did you have a good time when you went up to King's Lynn?'

Catherine: 'Yes.
It was very pleasant.
The the journey up there was erm'

Catherine: 'Mum said, your mum's going a bit mental?'

Catherine: 'Oh, probably is.'

Catherine: 'To put it politely.'

Catherine: 'I expect she is.'

Catherine: 'Does she see your brother much?'

Catherine: 'She sees Geoff, yes, but when she calls round.'

Catherine: 'Really?'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'Oh good.'

Catherine: 'Well my, my brother, well I, I'm, I'm happy she's er that she's comfortable'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'er i in her place.
It's been wonderful!'

Catherine: 'Mum said it's really nice.'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'What is it?
It's not is it an old people's home or is it something she paid for?'

Catherine: 'Along, along th that sort of line.
Erm you have a war, warden who lives on, the premises you have contact with the wardens and if there's any problems you can'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'pull a cord and they erm use a'

Catherine: 'It's a bit like the one we we, went to see Aunty Mary's when we to'

Catherine: 'Oh that's true.'

Catherine: 'tidy it up.'

Catherine: 'And this is really what'

Catherine: 'So is it, is it private or or erm'

Catherine: 'Well it's her trust.'

Catherine: 'Oh.'

Catherine: 'It's her trust.'

Catherine: 'So she pays?'

Catherine: 'She pays a certain amount, but erm you get erm'

Catherine: 'Subsidised.'

Catherine: 'That's right.
Yeah.
This is really what Ma-in-law should have done.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'About the same sort of thing.'

Catherine: 'Oh yeah.'

Catherine: 'Well, just to sit there it's a, I, I, know mum was fed up.'

Catherine: 'Sorry?'

Catherine: 'Mum's fed up.'

Catherine: 'Oh yeah.
She was telling me the other day.
But it's just'

Catherine: 'But erm'

Catherine: 'I dunno, it's just so awful!'

Catherine: 'Well'

Catherine: 'It just turned everything so sour.'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'But it probably was, I mean probably deep down if we didn't see her [UNK], probably got on quite well with her.
But you, you just see to much of her that now'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'that it's just got no got no wanting to talk to her or'

Catherine: 'Mm!'

Catherine: 'or no, you know, anything.'

Catherine: 'Well no, you see'

Catherine: 'Well perhaps she's got nothing to say, but she doesn't do anything.'

Catherine: 'I don't know.
But the problem I became very angry years ago with that because, I mean Irish Close and we had the three of you we found that she'd, she just kept on telling us off.
And, oh, I'll go in, get th Catherine's present, I mean, it wasn't and, there was no thought at all toward'

Catherine: 'No.'

Catherine: 'the children.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'And as I say, there was always one I remember that sticks passively in my mind when she came over in one December five weekends on the trot!'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
Mm mm.'

Catherine: 'I was going mental!'

Catherine: 'Well that's it.
So what did she say to you?'

Catherine: 'Nothing.'

Catherine: 'Well, [UNK]'

Catherine: 'I do, I hope but we appreciated Claire and Steven had her more than we had, but you know, we've had the odd times we've virtually been across there a month or something like, but but when you have a position where you have five'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'people in the house'

Catherine: 'It's very stressful.'

Catherine: 'I'm sorry, you know, the woman, I, er, I've tried to tell her in no uncertain terms there'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'isn't a space there.'

Catherine: 'Well not if it's not designed for it.'

Catherine: 'I said to her, I was saying it to Mum earlier, if that was me with a family, I'd wake up to the fact that you're pa, I, I I, there's too many here.'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'And course it's reached the point of no return now where she she can't do anything for herself.'

Catherine: 'Well there's nothing, yeah.
You just can't do it.'

Catherine: 'But if we, what she has done is soured the relationship with us'

Catherine: 'Mm mm.'

Catherine: 'between Claire and Steve, and also between Claire, Steve'

Catherine: 'Well it's'

Catherine: 'and herself.'

Catherine: 'Yes.
Which is such a shame because like, we all, wi, we all get on really well with William.'

Catherine: 'Sure.'

Catherine: 'You know, like more, more brother, si'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'brother sort of sister thing sort of thing than anything else.
But, you know, you don't wanna keep [UNK] her off.
Mum and Aunty, you know, Mum and Aunty get on well, and we all get you know, you get on with them as well, and all types of stuff.'

Catherine: 'But there is an underlined current there'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'which is erm, Mum is aware of.'

Catherine: 'Oh definitely.'

Catherine: 'But you know the situation is it's like Mum should not expect just because Claire and Steve go away that it's immediate pack your bag it's gonna co'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'and, and settle down in Brentwood.
I'm, I, I'm sorry.'

Catherine: 'It's happened too many times now that she's'

Catherine: 'You can'

Catherine: 'really just, you can't break it.'

Catherine: 'You can break it but the thing is that I warned her, er, you know, as long as they get through to her hold on that that's very nicely set up if she twiddles her [UNK]'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'and will continue to, to, to, erm so that the, the, the set-up should never have been created by her.'

Catherine: 'Very, very difficult.'

Catherine: 'Well that's why I said to you, and, and Laura, er to James, no way would we get ourselves in that position for you you have your lives to lead'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'get on with it.'

Catherine: 'There's no point ruining a good relationship by'

Catherine: 'That's right.
Yeah.'

Catherine: 'things like that.
Just turns everything sour.'

Catherine: 'So how was your weekend'

Only takes about takes about ten, not even that, to get to Witham station to get like to London and Kingston and e all your other sort'

Catherine: 'Oh I see!'

Catherine: 'of stuff.
Just sort of up that way.'

Catherine: 'Oh yes.
So that's good'

Catherine: 'So it's quite good'

Catherine: 'isn't it?'

Catherine: 'So it's quite, cos I mean Strawberry's Hill's about twenty five, twenty minutes, like the station, walk away.
So it's easier to go to Witham.
You have to change'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'at Twickenham though, that's not too'

Catherine: 'Oh oh.'

Catherine: 'bad.
But you can get to London in about twenty, twenty five minutes by car.'

Catherine: 'Oh.
That's alright.'

Catherine: 'And as well, as Vicky's on that line as well.
Vicky [UNK].
So I can get straight down, she's about four or five stops away from Witham.'

Catherine: 'Oh yeah.'

Catherine: 'So I must go and see her.
I was thinking maybe next weekend I might or meet her for the day'

Catherine: 'Yes, you must.'

Catherine: 'or something.'

Catherine: 'Yeah!
Well you'll have to go down there.'

Catherine: 'And she goes to Richmond quite a bit as well.
And Dave, her boyfriend's just started at Roehampton.
So we're all sort of in the same, very'

Catherine: 'Yes, oh yes you must'

Catherine: 'close vicinity'

Catherine: 'well'

Catherine: 'so we're all gonna go out for dinner or something.
We said'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'when we're all settled in.
So I must give her a ring this week actually.
I didn't realize how close we were.
I'm so, I've'

Catherine: 'No.'

Catherine: 'got no sense of geography, like, I just, didn't really, haven't got a clue.'

Catherine: 'You should, you should ge, if you look on a map you can, you can judge where'

Catherine: 'I know you can, but really I can't I just want a detailed like, even a detailed train map.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'Cos er, all the ones they have on the trains have got like Strawberry Hill and all the, that's all included, but then you buy a general map and we're all sort of cut off.
Well then'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'I haven't got a clue where I'm going.'

Catherine: 'No.'

Catherine: 'As for buses, I er, just haven't got a clue.
I never used one before until I came here.'

Catherine: 'Well, it's one of things you have to, I think you learn fast about er u using a'

Catherine: 'Honestly I'

Catherine: 'train for'

Catherine: 'I really haven't got a clue.'

Catherine: 'a form of transport.'

Catherine: 'So I don't even know names of roads, just tell people where I'm going.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
Haven't you supposed to er, er, have bought a local map yet?'

Catherine: 'Yeah, but I'm hopeless!'

Catherine: 'Mm mm.'

Catherine: 'I just like, I just like, I know places, like I was told when I was meeting the girls yesterday, I didn't know what road I was going on I was just telling like, people names of the pubs and luckily this, like, bloke behind me getting on the bus, said oh you need a like, a seventy P or something and that's when I knew where I was going and everyone's like telling me where to get off, everyone gestures to me.
I'm, they must think I'm so thick!
I just sit there looking completely lost waiting to see this pub go by before I know I can get off the bus.
And that's the way it goes.'

Catherine: 'Oh right.'

Catherine: 'Bit of a hopeless case come to think of it.'

Catherine: 'Maybe you should take a map with you Cath, because then you're able to follow the, where you are.'

Catherine: 'It's just such a worry though.'

Catherine: 'Well no, no.
No, no.
Take the, take the map with, stick it in your bag.'

Catherine: 'I just tell everyone I'm new in the area.
So I just say I'm really new in the area.
So my taxi driver like whizzes past my house, I go, oh I'm new in the area.
The thing is do, I don't think I'd know.
I wouldn't know how to get a bus [UNK].
I wouldn't have a clue where to go.'

Catherine: 'Oh no, I'd, I'd, I probably wouldn't either but er er, the thing is, it's the he e, having to live here for well say, at least three'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'years it's really matter of getting hold of a map'

Catherine: 'Oh yeah.'

Catherine: 'a a and using it.'

Catherine: 'I'm working my way slowly but surely'

Catherine: 'Ye you should'

Catherine: 'sh how to get around.'

Catherine: 'How we doing for time?
Mm.'

Catherine: 'Not bad.
It's always busy.'

Catherine: 'It's twenty five to ten.'

Catherine: 'Ho oh!
My God!'

Catherine: 'Mm mm.'

Catherine: 'Oh!
It smells so nice.'

Catherine: 'Well, okay.'

Catherine: 'You'll have to take mum out for a nice Indian once she feels better.
What's happening for James' birthday?'

Catherine: 'I don't know at the moment.
I haven't even thought about it.'

Catherine: 'At least he doesn't want a party.
You're safe'

Catherine: 'No, oh'

Catherine: 'with that one.'

Catherine: 'Well the thing is, er, I, I can'

Catherine: 'It's quite nice how sensible he is in a way.'

Catherine: 'I, I think he's drawing into his shell there as regards friends outside the family.
I think he realizes that er there's a heap lot of trouble out there'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'er er he could become involved'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'with if he just let go'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
Cos he's quite good in a, but it's so easy to get wrapped up with, obviously at that age it's very impressionable and very like they, they must look so big to a lot of people that they go out'

Catherine: 'Yes.'

Catherine: 'drinking or whatever, and causing trouble.'

Catherine: 'The thing is that, really, that they all they've done is show themselves up.
Cos'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'I, I was surprised when I heard of sort of the things that had happened.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'I'm sorry, but, you know, they're'

Catherine: 'I'm impressed with the warnings.
For phonings, warnings and phoning everybody up though.'

Catherine: 'Yeah sure.
Sure.'

Catherine: 'I think that's re, cos that's'

Catherine: 'He'

Catherine: 'the only way'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'cos the majority'

Catherine: 'Yes, you're right.'

Catherine: 'haven't got a clue'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
No.'

Catherine: 'what anybody does.'

Catherine: 'Yeah I know.
Ah yeah, I, I would think myself that I was also, er rather sorry that the boy doing had just shown how silly they'

Catherine: 'Silly.'

Catherine: 'are.'

Catherine: 'Even in somebody else's house you'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'just show respect.'

Catherine: 'Oh, yes.'

Catherine: 'I mean, no matter what you're doing yo, or where you are you just show respect for other'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'people's property or'

Catherine: 'And the other thing is what, I just wonder what's gonna happen on this trip because erm, some of them are away aren't they?'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'I hope the master'

Catherine: 'I think the teachers are gonna have to be there.'

Catherine: 'Well, they'll be'

Yeah, two more, do you want another Diet Coke?'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'Right.'

Catherine: 'Can I have a another two Diet Cokes please?
Thank you.'

Catherine: 'I think the teachers co, but I think the teachers realize what they are like.
I think they're just gonna have to be really, really strict with them.'

Catherine: 'Well, [UNK]'

Catherine: 'Well they would be o, they're representing too many people for them to misbehave.'

Catherine: 'Well I, [UNK].
I, I hope, in fact, that i, if one does th'

Catherine: 'It's no ignoring it'

Catherine: 'yeah, well the'

Catherine: 'till it'

Catherine: 'thing is, if one does in fact, they, they'd, they'd kick him off in fact and straight back'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'to the U K.'

Catherine: 'But it's such shame cos it's, I mean it's such a chance of a lifetime I just wish the trouble'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'would stop.'

Catherine: 'I think you'

Catherine: 'Cos I don't think, er no, I don't thi, there didn't seem to be any hassles with William's lot.'

Catherine: 'No, well but er it, it, it's it just strikes me as being a very, very immature when you're in another person's house'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
Lovely thanks.'

Catherine: 'Thanks.
Another person's house and you really just start wrecking the place systematically.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'It's sick!
You can turn them off [UNK].'

Catherine: 'Well it's very jazzy in the surrounding.'

Catherine: 'Oh yes.'

Catherine: 'I think I'll have those in the bedroom window.
Did you put my red light up yet?
I was telling Adrian that, you were putting a red light up in my bedroom that I as long as your brother kept coming home with all his friends.
And then Martin turned up, and then you turned up and my dad's like I'm sorry, what's going on?'

Catherine: 'Yes.
That's it.'

Catherine: 'Come on mate, I'm starving!'

Catherine: 'No, no advances on his, on his salary soon.'

Catherine: 'It reminds me a bit of, d'ya remember that place we stayed in Brussels?
Like und, that was underneath?
D'ya remember that res, you know when we went to Brussels and stayed above the sort of Indian restaurant?'

Catherine: 'Oh yes!
Yes I do.'

Catherine: 'Thanks very much.'

Catherine: 'Yes that was a little bit out.
But, ah yes, I remember.
Yes.
Yeah.
Cor!
You have a long memory.'

Catherine: 'Certainly have.
It's there somewhere.
Do you remember it?'

Catherine: 'Yes.'

Catherine: 'That's erm, that's quite a while ago actually.'

Catherine: 'Well yes, a couple of years ago.
It was when James went to Russia.'

Catherine: 'Oh!
That was it.'

Catherine: 'Er near, near er Skiptia'

Catherine: 'Oh yeah, that's why he wasn't there.'

Catherine: 'near Skiptov'

Catherine: 'Oh that was it.'

Catherine: 'Robert was in, at, at, University.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
Oh that was it.'

Catherine: 'She must have been away so we took flight.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
That was good actually.
It was quite nice.'

Catherine: 'Except of course, I er, I, I couldn't read my road map there in, in Brussels.
My goodness me!'

Catherine: 'Was a bit of a mare wasn't it?'

Catherine: 'Ah!
It was terrible.
Because the thing had changed so ma, so dramatically from when I was across there, that was the first thing that stopped me.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'And secondly, as regards where they were the road maps didn't seem that didn't coordinate that'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'well.'

Catherine: 'Has he got a job?'

Catherine: 'I do, I er, well I presume he's still working in fact, with this er with the bank.
Well I think the problem with, with what they have in Brussels now, they have so many underpasses in fact, and er, motorways that if you you come off the wrong it's a nightmare trying to get back'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'on the damn thing again.'

Catherine: 'Well I can't even find the M twenty five!'

Catherine: 'No.
I was surprised it to, we well going to this place yesterday er, on the directions we were with Tammy, she was reading them out and we come off the M twenty'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'five on the M four, the M four we look for er er exit eight is it eight?
Yes it is.
After that, we started in trouble.
We went into the village of that's right, we went to, saw the signpost for Bray, they said, when you come al, along the road, erm you'll find a signpost before the motorway, er, sign for the motorway on yo, to, to, to Bray.
Oh yeah?
Bang!
We were on the motorway'

Catherine: 'where's this bloody sign!'

Catherine: 'So, we went along for, about five minutes, couldn't pick anything up so we stopped and asked this, someone where Mo Monkey Island was.
Oh you have to go back down there and turn er, left underneath, underneath the motorway.
But, when we came back, yes, there's a sign there, but it didn't tell you the other side, you have to come'

Catherine: 'okay'

Catherine: 'You have to lose your way, come back, yeah.'

Catherine: 'That's it.
So we we, we turned down this road, through the village and we couldn't find Monkey Island.'

Catherine: 'Oh!'

Catherine: 'Oh!'

Catherine: 'Oh alright.
Fair enough.
So we stopped again.
I went across and yes it's, you have to go back er a a a again, and when the road narrows, just after the, the, the narrow in the road, you take the first left.
So, up we go the road narrows straight past the first left, there isn't a sign for Monkey Island at all.'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'I said, what the bloody hell's happening here?
So went in the car park, turned back took the first er er, er well I did a right then'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'there it was, suddenly at the end of the road, Monkey Island.
But you know, everything else said it would be signposted, yes it's great.'

Catherine: 'Well it would be, yeah.'

Catherine: 'Ah!'

Catherine: 'Really great!
And we weren't the only ones who said they lost out cos it er'

Catherine: 'I'm not surprised.'

Catherine: 'Terrible!
Terrible!'

Catherine: 'So what is it, a, an actual island?'

Catherine: 'It's an actual island, yes, and you see'

Catherine: 'And how bi, quite big, it must be quite big.
Is it big?'

Catherine: 'It's not that large, but it's, yo yo get a'

Catherine: 'You just take it over for the weekend?'

Catherine: 'Well, we, we, we, mo most people there, there were nineteen of us, but there were a few other people there on, on the place itself, and what you have is er, a bridge from the mainland across to the island'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'the th, the, the Thames in fact, must go underneath.
It's quite a fast ride and it's quite high too'

Catherine: 'Oh I see.'

Catherine: 'because of the water.
But this was a boat was saw s, over the up the side of the mainland, in fact, which had been er whether it had been tied up too tight in fact I wo, now, now for leeway and the thing had just sunk.'

Catherine: 'Oh.
Oh blimey!'

Catherine: 'Yeah th, the water level's just'

Catherine: 'Really?'

Catherine: 'just a, you know, way up above the the main er'

Catherine: 'thing, yeah.
But, there's the the main, er, hotel that you book into and you come away from there to the dining area and erm and the reception [UNK]'

Catherine: 'Oh I see.'

Catherine: 'Oh quite pleasant.'

Catherine: 'Oh crikey!

Catherine: 'Where was it?'

Catherine: 'Oh bloody Geneva, er, Switzerland.'

Catherine: 'That's it.
I couldn't think where you'd been to.'

Catherine: 'Oh.'

Catherine: 'No, i, it should be that.
The worst of it in fact, er, as I say, Friday evening I didn't have a lot to drink I was determined not to have a lot because I, I find the reaction'

Catherine: 'It's not worth it just for one week is it?'

Catherine: 'and then Sa Saturday, well, I went, well this morning I went through some, I got up at half past six I did some'

Catherine: 'Why d'ya get up so early?'

Catherine: 'You know just to well ease myself in really.

Catherine: 'Oh that's right.'

Catherine: 'Erm, and then, I, I got out the room about er twenty to nine.'

Catherine: 'Ah oh.'

Catherine: 'You know.'

Catherine: 'You're not as dumb as you look are you?'

Catherine: 'No, no.

Quite a dab hand at the washing up at the moment.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.

Got a lot less at home than erm'

Catherine: 'I'm not doing, I'm not doing it, I've piled it all up and left it.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
Well a cup of whatsername stuff I poured down the sink upstairs rather than get it kicked over because if they come back in a silly state then they'll knock it all over books.'

Catherine: 'Sure.
Oh'

Catherine: 'So'

Catherine: 'don't worry about that.
That'll be their books upstairs.'

Catherine: 'Ah but it's silly because the thing is, th the they're, well the, th those, th those two rooms look as if a bloody tip has hit it!'

Catherine: 'Oh yeah.
Well that was the room as well that we had the leak from so then we had the neighbour up there.
There's a massive erm I don't even know what you call it, of dope like'

Catherine: 'Oh yes.'

Catherine: 'this, er in there because I, I hid that because I mean, I don't know er like if anybody, I mean I only know what it was cos somebody told me'

Catherine: 'Yeah sure.'

Catherine: 'like if anybody else saw it it just looks like a piece of dirt.
And it was, honestly, it was such a mess and Angie and I were like, oh this isn't our room.
Oh this isn't our room.
We had to like tell her about five times so they knew it wasn't our room as we like took this guy in it was like books, everything was, there was so much crap on the floor, we had to get through to get to the radiator so that our next door neighbour could try and like stop it from leaking.'

Catherine: 'Oh dear!'

Catherine: 'So embarrassed in case they thought it was us, and you know like, really embarrassed.
I saw him the other day and he said ah yo, have you, not leaking yet is it from that radiator?
He was really friendly actually, he got him out, and it was quite, sort of good to help us with it, you know, I just didn't have a clue.
Especially when you have like, we had boiling water pouring out of there.
You know, like trying to stop it with our finger'

Catherine: 'Yeah, sure, yeah.'

Catherine: 'and it was ju, it was burning our finger'

Catherine: 'Yo, yes sure.
And squirting'

Catherine: 'And they'

Catherine: 'the'

Catherine: 'yeah, they had like like three towels.'

Catherine: 'It's only, it's only a little thing isn't it, in fact, with the thread on?'

Catherine: 'Yeah, that's what fell out.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'I mean, I dunno, obviously it hadn't been done, or maybe Angie undid it too much or whatever.'

Catherine: 'Undid it too much, yeah sure.
Yes you'd have to be'

Catherine: 'And then just it was, it was literally spurting out'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'and it, we thought it would stop, but obviously, the water's'

Catherine: 'No, no, no.'

Catherine: 'been pumped through'

Catherine: 'Pumping through, yeah.
And course it's got, pushing it'

Catherine: 'So we still had all this boiling water'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'and we didn't think, and sort of, then we realized that had to sort of like turn it off and that might help a bit, but boiling water, we're trying to stop it with our finger.
And of course the pressure of the, the heat was just like killing us.'

Catherine: 'Mm mm.'

Catherine: 'Soaking wet towels everywhere, water spurting on the wall, and like everywhere'

Catherine: 'Oh God!
Yeah.'

Catherine: 'And you got, in the end we just laughed.'

Catherine: 'And it, it came through to you?
It came through yours?'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
Because, I suddenly, oh that was even funnier because I was I suddenly went Angie I think we've got a leak, and it was like all on the, all in my windowsill and sort of like came down and then, luckily, she said she only realized because of what I did last year, leaving my sink on, that it goes through the floor, otherwise, none of what, we wouldn't have realized.
So, then she said, oh right, I'll get on your desk just to check that it's alright, so she got, took my work essays off, and she got on my desk and then I said, oh I'll help you down, so she sat on my desk to get off and of course it's not attached'

Catherine: 'Oh!
No!'

Catherine: 'so she leant forward and whole thing went flying forward.
Angie went flying off, my pens went everywhere!'

Catherine: 'Oh God!'

Catherine: 'And we just lay on the floor laughing because it was just getting from bad to worse.'

Catherine: 'What happened to your word processor?'

Catherine: 'It was fine because I'd moved it, luckily, I'd'

Catherine: 'Oh I see.'

Catherine: 'And then about erm from about an hour, about half an hour later after we'd sat down we're just laughing our heads off because the gi, they'd gone down the pub and we said no, we'll have a quiet night in.
And then about half an hour later Mark turned up completely out of his face!'

Catherine: 'Oh no!'

Catherine: 'Cut leg cos he'd kicked a car and his leg was all bleeding so he had to'

Catherine: 'Oh!'

Catherine: 'like try and mend that.
Then he went to go to the loo and nearly did a complete backward flip down the stairs.'

Catherine: 'Oh God!'

Catherine: 'And then he went into the bathroom locked the door and it was just silent.
And, like, we left him there for about five minutes and we just didn't hear a thing'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'cos we were wo, we all got really worried, we're like, Mark.'

[UNK]: 'Mella Mentha?
Bombay Cassata?'

Catherine: 'Thank you.
Thank you.'

Catherine: 'I wanted a Lemon Delight.'

[UNK]: 'You Lemon Delight?'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'Sorry.
Thanks.
Didn't think that looked like a Lemon Delight.
And erm'

Catherine: 'Delicious!'

Catherine: 'Oh!'

Catherine: 'Wanna take this stuff as a souvenir?'

Catherine: 'Well I'll take the umbrella, yeah.'

Catherine: 'Oh.
Great!'

Catherine: 'Tuck in.
Start.'

Catherine: 'No that's alright.
It won't get cold.'

Catherine: 'So of course, it was deadly silent in there for like erm oh it won't get cold!
I've just heard what you said.
Oh dear.
I'm on the ball tonight.'

Catherine: 'Someone is slowing up.'

Catherine: 'It's getting late.
So, like we all, we're all set to barge the door down.
We're banging on the door going Mark, are you alright?
And there was no answer.
So we thought I, so we said look, we're gonna have to break it down.
Course we like, started banging the door and all of a sudden we heard this really like, laugh, you know Mark'

Catherine: 'Oh God!'

Catherine: 'having a laugh on our behalf.
So he came out and we really slapped him hard!
We thought that was'

Catherine: 'Oh God!'

Catherine: 'really out of order.
But, and then he, he's like, we left him on the sofa and said oh Mark we'll be back in a minute, like, turned all the lights off hoping he'll like pass out you could just hear him like laughing to himself for another like twenty minutes and we're'

Catherine: 'Oh God!'

Catherine: 'in the kitchen going, we just wanted him to pass out.
And then luckily, it suddenly went really quiet and he obviously wore himself out and like was having a sleep.
And we're just like, oh God!
And then he woke up the next morning and threw up everywhere.'

Catherine: 'Oh no!
Oh dear.'

Catherine: 'And then I, I was coming back from lectures at, as he was like leaving our house and he looked a really sorry state.
He'd put this massive like, plaster on his leg and he was going oh I'm a nancy boy cos I've got a plaster on.
So we wrote nancy boy all up his leg on this plaster.
And he walking round with these shorts on from last night, and his like, dirty T shirt and this big plaster with nancy boy written on it trying to get home.'

Catherine: 'Has he found a place now then or is he'

Catherine: 'Yeah, he's gonna be in Isleworth.
Which is quite a way out actually.
It's'

Catherine: 'What's'

Catherine: 'on the way to'

Catherine: 'and he's gotta, he's gotta come into here has he, every day?'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'Bloody hell!'

[UNK]: 'You alright?'

Catherine: 'Yes.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.

So, yeah it's erm I think he's living with Marion told him about the house, it's one of the girls who was in English last year with her, Maureen, he's living with her and another girl, and another boy.'

Catherine: 'Oh I see.'

Catherine: 'He seems to be fine so, it seems to be working out well.'

Catherine: 'Too, too long a journey to get drunk every, each night won't you?
Oh eh?'

Catherine: 'Oh he does it anyway.
I think he'll just crash at our house.
He knows he's'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'he's more than welcome to crash at ours.
I mean, it's quite, it's about yeah, I don't know, he said it's about a forty minute walk or something.
Or a ten, fifteen minute cycle ride.'

Catherine: 'Oh yes.'

Catherine: 'Our cycle ride's just about long enough.'

Catherine: 'And he's, he, he he doesn't'

Catherine: 'It's get'

Catherine: 'drive?'

Catherine: 'the worst bit is Lincoln Avenue and Meadway, once you get to Meadway it's sort of like you know, it's like'

Catherine: 'Yeah, sure.
Yes.'

Catherine: 'that is, well that is, and that's like the longest, even'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'like the longest bit, the walk into college seems to be, that bit.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'Cos the rest of it is just basically straight across basically you're just cutting across.'

Catherine: 'Oh I see.'

Catherine: 'Well yo well basically all the ma, there's like three or four main roads and we just cut straight across it like it.'

Catherine: 'Mm mm.'

Catherine: 'And everywhere, like at Strawberry Hill Station and college.
And that's you know, the worst bit seems to be Lincoln Avenue, just seems to go on forever!'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'Luckily, we're no further down, I think we'd die!'

Catherine: 'There's quite a stretch though there.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
You can ca, and it carries on for miles around as well doesn't it?
Joining on the motorway bit.'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'Made it for me specially.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
Quite nice.'

Catherine: 'Is it?'

Catherine: 'It's beautiful.
Mm.
Bombay so, si, er er [UNK] up there will be out now.'

Catherine: 'It's quite nice thought because it, you're getting exercise as well and, and you've got to do it to get into'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'college so yo, you know, yo whereas at home if you've got the home i, it's easier to get, you know, to get in a car.'

Catherine: 'Oh sure.'

Catherine: 'The weather's a bit grotty or you know, or you're not feeling too good, it's easier to get a car, you know, to get a lift in with someone.
I don't mind cycling.'

Catherine: 'What they've done they've put this onto a warm plate, that's why it's melting so much.'

Catherine: 'Oh, oh ah!
Everything's kept in ovens round here.
In these little Baby Belling type ones.
I wonder how much money they make?'

Catherine: 'They do pretty well.'

Catherine: 'Oh yes.
Right.'

[UNK]: 'Sorry about that.'

Catherine: 'That's alright.

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'What is it, pistachio I might have a bit of pistachio actually.
Nice actually.
It's nice and light.'

Catherine: 'Beautiful!
So what time do you expect your friends home this evening?'

Catherine: 'Don't know.
If they've gone to the see this, to the see, Goats don't Shave then I doubt they'll be back till a, about midnight, one o'clock, if they get the train back if not, tomorrow morning or something.'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'Well they're altogether so I suppose'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'in that way they're relatively safe.
So don't sit up worrying about them.
But erm they're bloody daft if they did what they did last time anyway!'

Catherine: 'Oh yes.'

Catherine: 'Cos I was gonna go with them and then a, just would have costed like, quite a bit it's about seven pounds to get in plus your stuff, like, wai, transport there and transport back.
Blimey!
Plus, you'll er, you'll have a, like a couple of drinks there, even if it's Cokes or anything, but your you know, it'll still be a long night.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'But apparently, it's meant to be really good there.
Really good erm like Irish, sort of pub.'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'Pub.
But I would, I will go there sometime.
But I [UNK].'

Catherine: 'Lovely.'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'Is yours alright?'

Catherine: 'Very nice.
Want a bit?'

Catherine: 'Oh that's nice.'

Catherine: 'Something cold and refreshing actually.'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'Cos next, well the week after the reading week we've got, we do the first visit to our schools that we're doing our T P in.'

Catherine: 'Oh oh!
Will your transport be laid on or'

Catherine: 'I don't know what, well the I mean it's all paid for so we'd either depending how many people are going [UNK] away or whatever'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'then erm there'

Catherine: 'What's'

Catherine: 'might be a coach.
If not, apparently, they've worked out how everyone will actually go to school.'

Catherine: 'So, you'll see.'

Catherine: 'So I'll just see.
But we'll be told beforehand, or I'll find out.
Cos also, I don't mind, mind going on public transport as long as I know how to get there.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

Catherine: 'If I'm told to get the whatever bus.'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'

Catherine: 'Cos I, otherwise I'll be no good at working it out for myself.'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'Wouldn't have a clue.
But I think, I, I think I'd get a train straight through but I don't really know.'

Catherine: 'How often do you [UNK] that then? [UNK]'

Catherine: 'Well the train.
Cos a few people are further out than me so cos Angie's just up the road in Hamworth.
Which is like just a se, it's about twenty minutes walk from our houses I think.'

Catherine: 'Oh.'

Catherine: 'So it's fine.
Cos loads of us are gonna be getting back into like evenings when you're really tired.
Cos what's, well what's quite good is you do a week and then we've got, it's our half term so we've got a week off.'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'And then we do another four weeks.'

Catherine: 'Oh.'

Catherine: 'I think the first week is just sort of basically erm we share with the teacher and only do, say, a couple of lessons a we, couple of lessons a day'

Catherine: 'Sure.'

Catherine: 'and maybe like read to them at the end of the day or whatever.
The, I think, well then after half term then it's more us, we're the teacher and we sort of take it after'

Catherine: 'Oh I see.'

Catherine: 'half term.'

Catherine: 'And what sort of age?'

Catherine: 'I'm with erm nine and ten years olds.'

Catherine: 'Mm.'

Catherine: 'Year five.
Yeah.
I think so.'

Catherine: 'Oh yeah.'

Catherine: 'I know, but I've never ever taught that age group before.'

Catherine: 'Well thump them one will you?'

Catherine: 'Every time they get cocky, thump them!'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
I've only taught erm seven and eight year olds.
So it'll be quite an experience.'

Catherine: 'Mhm.'

Catherine: 'It's gonna be so exhausting though.
You get, we get assessed on it as well.'

Catherine: 'Oh well.'

Catherine: 'You fail those things and you're out basically.'

Catherine: 'Is there a, is there, is that a fact?
So you really have to have a sort of strong character and in you go.
And so'

Catherine: 'Yeah.
Basically lesson pattern stuff.
Cos when we go in after winter break that's when we'll find out er what topics they're doing so we can plan our lessons and'

Catherine: 'Oh I see.'

Catherine: 'fit in with whatever, like their curriculum.'

Catherine: 'Well if you want anything er er photocopied or put together let me know won't you?
Cos I can always sort of'

Catherine: 'Yeah.'
