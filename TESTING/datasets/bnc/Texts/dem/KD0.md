Paul: 'Dunno.
Geoff Thomas sent for [UNK]'

Kevin: 'He asked on your behalf didn't he?'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'Well you can't ask any more of Geoff Thomas than that I suppose.
I wonder why that little bit was in the paper about Geoff Thomas being absolutely priceless?
Was it cos someone's'

Paul: 'What bit?'

Kevin: 'someone's after him again?'

Paul: 'What bit?'

Kevin: 'There was a little article in the Sun I told you about.
Alan Smith saying Geoff Thomas is absolutely priceless.
Er all he's got to do is score more goals.
That's what I couldn't understand.
What a nerve!
. I think he meant for England.
All he had to do to seal his England career was pop in a two, a few goals like he does at Palace'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'and er could be on the way to a regular spot.'

Paul: 'He is in a regular spot at the moment.'

Kevin: 'Well I don't know.
Hope, hope that's true.
Yeah but well you look that that jaguar four litres!
. Four litre car!'

Paul: 'Yeah but what are you gonna do with four litres?'

Kevin: 'I dunno.
Well quite.
It does about eighteen miles to the gallon.'

Paul: 'How many miles do we do to the gallon?'

Kevin: 'I hope we do something like thirty six.'

Paul: 'Thirty six!'

Kevin: 'Don't think it's much more than that.'

Paul: 'How can his, well [UNK] if ours is one point six there's three times'

Kevin: 'No it doesn't work that way.'

Paul: 'It doesn't work like that?'

Kevin: 'No.'

Paul: 'So what how long will it take him to get eighty miles filling up every?'

Kevin: 'Well I mean do they have huge tanks?
I mean they take if you, if you filled up you could put I think it's about twenty six gallons in that car.'

Paul: 'And how many can we put in?'

Kevin: 'Nine?
Eleven?'

Paul: 'Cor.'

Kevin: 'Eleven.
It was eight, nine.
I think this might take eleven.'

Paul: 'So how much do they spend if they filled it [UNK]?'

Kevin: 'Don't forget if you've got all that weight, you've got that you're gonna lose even more petrol.'

Paul: 'So if you filled that up, how much would that cost them?'

Kevin: 'Well, twenty six I think it's something like isn't it something like two pounds a gallon now?
You don't, they do it all by litres now so it's really hard'

Paul: 'About fifty P?
About fifty, fifty pounds?
Fifty pounds to fill up!'

Kevin: 'Yeah.
Oh yeah fifty, sixty pounds.'

Paul: 'And how long would it last them?
About the same time as us?'

Kevin: 'Yeah.'

Paul: 'I suppose you have to be able to afford all that if you can afford the car in the first place.'

Paul: 'Right.
Yeah if you have to moan about that you shouldn't be driving it in the first place.'

Paul: 'Motto, what?
Motto of the story is er er don't, don't buy expensive cars if you're gonna want to run the thing though.
You've spent all your money on this car.
All of a sudden you realize [UNK]'

Kevin: 'Well like that new advert for the Rover he says don't, I keep thinking my back my back tailgate's flapping or I keep hearing, you keep hearing creaking don't you?
A creak here and you think what's that, what's this, what's that?
So that new Rover has been built so everything fits perfectly, right?
So nothing rattles.'

Paul: 'What do you mean nothing?'

Kevin: 'No toleran er the tolerance is you know minimal.
Whereas the tolerance here'd be I dunno eighth of an inch here eighth of an inch there he says the advert says as soon as you have tolerances like that then thing work loose and start rattling and creaking and'

Paul: 'E E.'

Kevin: 'you can hear it go E E er E.'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: '[UNK] you imagine cruising in a car, lovely car like that and it makes no noise.
Just cruising away and it just like glides, and you glide you know like, like Papa's Citroen type that kind of suspension.'

Paul: 'A Rover.'

Kevin: 'Was it that Rover?'

Paul: 'Yeah.
Was this a new, is this a new Rover [UNK]?'

Kevin: 'Carving everybody up.
Yes.
That was er that, yeah well it's not out yet is it?
Looks like a looks like the front of a B M W to me.
I think that's what they're trying to emulate.'

Paul: 'Oh that one.
How much is it?
Supposed to be.'

Kevin: 'Don't know how much it costs.
Should think it starts at about sixteen, seventeen thousand [UNK].'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'A three's heavy isn't it?
Look.'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'So you got any ideas what you're gonna get, what you should get mum for [UNK]?'

Paul: 'What what sort of thing are you gonna get her?'

Kevin: '[UNK] there's some funny little weird shops down Thornton Heath aren't there?'

Paul: 'What sort of thing are we talking about?'

Kevin: 'Well I dunno.

Kevin: 'Could get her some, some toiletries or something.

There is a Moss chemist on the way.'

Kevin: 'Oh yes she did tell me that she'd like some of that.'

Paul: 'Yes there is one isn't there?
By [UNK] shops. [UNK]'

Kevin: 'Right we, we'll we'll treat that as a fail safe then.
If we can't see anything more unusual suppose we could always fall back on the bubble baths or the anyway I think that's a bit more than [UNK] but there you go.'

## 017006

Paul: 'Yeah it's going round.
Why must you check, every time?'

Kevin: 'Cos I think sometimes it doesn't [UNK].
You just sit there thinking you're taping and you're not.'

Paul: 'Oh.
Er how did she get it on there?'

Kevin: 'Pooh.
Mummy's gonna say that's very strong, Paul.
In fact put it at the back somewhere I think [UNK] pong.'

Paul: 'No.
Why should we have it in the back?'

Kevin: 'That's it.'

Paul: 'Really strong innit?'

Kevin: 'Can you put that in the in the glovebox then please.'

Paul: 'Do you wanna bit of this?'

Kevin: 'No thank you [UNK] Bounty [UNK] What's the Egbert fund?
I'm supporting the Egbert fund.
Do you know it?'

Paul: 'Looks like er the spastic one.'

Kevin: 'Oh.
No we've picked the wrong one there.
I don't think we'll pick spice again, do you?'

Paul: 'No.
Ooh!'

Kevin: 'Smells like somebody's lavatory.
Looks like you'll have to sort of like put it up for a day and then take it down for a week and put it back in again.
It's too much for one day.
You shou, perhaps you should have kept the bag on it.
You know it's too strong to [UNK].
You take the bag off, off it after a month or something.'

Kevin: 'Even your Bounty must taste a bit poorly.
Yeah?
Yeah.'

Paul: 'Bet the bloke listening to this can hear it smell it.'

Kevin: 'I know.
Put it in there.'

Paul: '[UNK].
[UNK] open the glovebox when we get [UNK]'

Kevin: 'Yeah.
Er hang on though, perhaps that's not so good.
I, it might make the sweets taint.'

Paul: 'Mm.'

Kevin: 'I reckon we'll when, when we get out we'll put it in the boot and it'll filter through through on its own.
Ooh dear!'

Paul: 'How about just keeping it in the bag?'

Kevin: 'It's overcoming me.'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'Open your window, quick.'

Paul: 'Oh look.'

Kevin: 'Panic.
Not everybody's window, Paul.
Ah!
Strewth Pauly.'

Paul: '[UNK] Disgusting.
I'll just keep it down there.
In the bag.
Oh it's disgusting smell.'

Kevin: 'And why did you hit this car?
Well you see'

Kevin: 'my son took his magic pongo tree out'

Kevin: 'and I was overcome, thus hitting the car in front.
I see Mr [UNK].
Do you expect us to believe that do you?'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'Yes.
He is an idiot.'

Paul: 'Can you leave that alone!'

Kevin: 'I leant on it.'

Paul: 'Lean out a bit cos I'm shutting the windows again.'

Kevin: 'No I want it.
I [UNK]'

Kevin: 'I hope this traffic jam's not all the way to Croydon.
I do so hope.
Oh can you imagine what that Purley Way's gonna be like?
Forget the s, egg and chips Pauly.
Forget mummy's present.
Oh what are they having here now?
The Christmas fair.'

Paul: 'At the moment I'm just trying to forget that awful spice stuff.'

Kevin: '[UNK] innit?'

Kevin: 'Yeah I think you did wrong.
You should, you shouldn't have er yeah.
You shouldn't have er opened the packet.
It's funny that shop didn't smell of it did it?
So I mean the seal must keep it all in until you open it up.'

Paul: 'Ugh ugh.
[UNK] open it ugh [UNK].'

Kevin: 'No it's quite a nice smell if it's like taken out now.
We'll put it in the boot or it'll just be sickening on the way home.'

Paul: 'Yeah.
[UNK] person listening to this tape will probably go ah.'

Kevin: 'I can smell it when I'm listening to it!'

Kevin: 'There's our little football group.
Look, it's getting bigger and bigger.'

Paul: 'What little football group?'

Kevin: 'There!'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'Got a lady teaching, got a team to go there.
Do you remember that lady that ran the team at er St John's?'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'Quite keen.'

Paul: 'Oh yeah, her.'

Kevin: '[UNK] how her little team got on.
Whether it folded or not.'

Paul: 'Probably did.'

Kevin: 'I think a lot of them do.
Yeah.
You imagine what Purley Way's gonna be like ton, today.
Christmas shopping.'

Paul: 'Awful [UNK]'

Kevin: 'Oh we're taking forget two o'clock.
I said two o'clock we'd be parking.
Stopped for petrol I suppose.'

Paul: 'Yeah but dad, not for that long.
So when will we park now?
Set an estimate [UNK]'

Kevin: 'Well look there's an [UNK] estimation look they're parking, they're queuing on this brow of the hill instead of the other one.
Everybody's got Christmas fairs on haven't they?
Look, balloons.
This is the day.'

Paul: 'Yeah.
No, fifteenth is the day.'

Kevin: 'Or sixth [UNK]'

Paul: 'Are we going to?
Yeah.
It's the toy service tomorrow isn't it?'

Kevin: 'Is it?
Yeah.'

Paul: 'That really is a strong [UNK]'

Kevin: '[UNK] No it could, you could overcome, I wonder if there's a warning on the packet.
Do not open this and drive at the same time.
Really heady.
On an empty stomach it's made me feel quite queasy.
Oh look he's done, someone's done that to his, look, look.
Smashed his wing mirror, look [UNK] jam a glass in it, er sock in it to stop the glass falling out.
Oh it's not too bad.'

Kevin: 'Yes Paul.
Well really you should have read shouldn't you?'

Paul: 'Dad!
You told me to take it all the way out.'

Paul: 'Should have got that blue one.
I knew that was your fault.
Stinks!'

Kevin: 'Yes but you opened it all.'

Paul: 'Actually I don't even want it anywhere near me.
Ah.
It's gone all my nose funny now.'

Kevin: '[UNK] nose I've got [UNK] my asthma.'

Paul: 'Asthma.
Asthma.'

Paul: 'By the way, if you can hear a word I say you're better than I am.
Oh get this out.
Phew.
I'll have to lob that [UNK]'

Kevin: 'That car's got smile just to annoy everybody.'

Paul: 'What?'

Kevin: 'Smile, just to annoy everybody that blue Datsun says on [UNK]'

Paul: 'What does that, what does that mean?'

Kevin: 'Ooh, yeah be pleasant and ooh.
There you are, look, look'

Paul: 'You can read that ah.
I thought you meant that what about the one in front of it then?'

Kevin: 'Baby on board.
I can't stand those ones.'

Paul: 'Can you see?'

Kevin: 'Well I can see [UNK]'

Paul: 'I can see the baby.
Well a baby is on board.
Give them their due.
Oh, oh it's made all my throat go all funny.
Pay someone to take it away.
Very long lasting.
Yes, very long lasting.
Hang on, I'm just opening the window again.'

## 017007

Paul: 'Recording commences at three past two.
With [UNK].'

Kevin: 'Got a Palace picture on.'

Paul: 'Man United!'

Kevin: 'Oh.
Don't let them out.
They can stay there.
We hate United.'

## 017008

Paul: 'Hello again.'

Kevin: 'Hello, hello, hello.
Who is that munching cashews on the tape.'

Kevin: 'Here we go, you go right close, go ah!'

Kevin: 'You wicked trickster you. [UNK]'

Paul: 'Would you like a cashew nut?'

Kevin: 'You can't have a cashew nut.'

Paul: 'Oh come on.
I like the big ones.'

Kevin: 'You would.'

Paul: 'That's me!
Mm'

Kevin: 'Tasted nicer ones.'

Paul: 'Can't afford to eat them like that!'

Kevin: 'Mm can.
Mm.
Lovely.'

Paul: 'Should eat them about a quarter at a time.'

Kevin: 'Why are the dearest things the nicest?'

Paul: 'Don't eat them like that!'

Kevin: 'Mm.
I can't, look at you eating them like that.'

Paul: 'One at a time.'

Kevin: 'Oh look Pauly hot rod.'

Paul: 'Hot rod!
Woo woo, nice.'

Kevin: 'Mm.
No!
That means give me the packet.
Hurry up, come on.'

Paul: 'What?'

Kevin: 'Quick.
Give me the packet please, they're mine.
What me?
[UNK] What.
Oh that's where you should go for your computer, look.
P C World.'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'This bit's not so bad.
Once you get through that traffic light back there'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'it's alright.'

Paul: 'Mm.
Soon as these lights go we should get here, through here quite quickly.'

Kevin: 'Mm.'

Paul: 'Long lights.
I command thee to become orange.
Orange.'

Kevin: 'Well it's so long for the [UNK].
They make them longer during the evenings and Saturday.'

Paul: 'Orange!'

Kevin: 'And this lot have got to go first haven't they?'

Paul: 'Mm.
Yeah [UNK].'

Kevin: 'Quite ridiculous.
Far too long.'

Paul: 'Far too long, yeah.
How do people know it's gonna change?
They just sort of start their engines [UNK] still red.
[UNK] changes.'

Kevin: 'Regulars down here I should imagine.'

Paul: 'Where?'

Kevin: 'Regulars probably who come down here and know'

Paul: 'Regulars.
They can count.'

Kevin: 'Yeah.'

Paul: 'No they can probably see down the end and they [UNK]'

Kevin: 'Well these lights used to be quite easy, didn't mind being stopped by them.
Now you're petrified of being stopped by any of them cos you know it's'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'really long wait.'

Paul: 'When are they gonna bring those towers down?'

Kevin: 'Don't know.'

Paul: 'Which way would they tumble them?'

Kevin: 'I don't think they're in any rush to develop now, are they cos this housing business is so poor.
whoever's got the land has decided'

Paul: '[UNK] are they boarded off.
You can't go up there any more?'

Kevin: 'No.
That is so naff isn't it?
Putting your scarf across the car like that.'

Paul: 'I know.
What's it say.'

Kevin: 'Crystal Palace.
Least it says Crystal Palace.'

## 017101

Kevin: 'Right.
Who shall we, who shall we get'

Paul: 'What?'

Kevin: 'as a replacement for somebody.
Who is there?
Who would you like?
If we had all the money.
Buy Ian Wright back I suppose.'

Paul: 'No.
I'd sell Bright.
No I wouldn't sell Bright.
I'd buy someone first.
Make sure someone was interested in [UNK].
I'd buy Deane and swap Bright in exchange for Deane.
No matter how bad he doesn't like it he's well and truly gutted.
Er so him for Deane and'

Kevin: 'Yeah but Deane won't be available till the end of the season.
There's no way Sheffield United [UNK]'

Paul: 'Er I dunno.'

Kevin: 'just stoking the price up I think.
Cos it's not old Bassett now, this is what it's all about.
[UNK] to get the odd draw you need the odd goal and er it's not gonna come from any other people than er'

Paul: 'Oh yeah, Deane.'

Kevin: 'Deane.
But Deane didn't score today.
It was Beazley apparently.
Beazley.'

Paul: 'Beazley.
Er I might see if I could pick up that Sheffield United guy Jamie Hoyland.
He's quite good.'

Kevin: 'As you say the main problem is, as you say is are you going to change your whole team, game [UNK]'

Paul: 'Yeah.
I don't know.
I think they'll do it slowly but not this slowly.
I mean I th I think we should have bought someone along with er Gabbiadini to play with him.
[UNK] could just bring him and expect [UNK] stuff.
Mm could you get'

Kevin: 'I think he's gonna have to raid the bottom divisions again, you know.'

Paul: 'What sort of bottom divisions?'

Kevin: '[UNK] he's probably got his eye on [UNK].
I mean that Coleman was a very good buy wasn't he?
Yeah? [UNK]'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'How much did he cost? [UNK]'

Paul: 'Three hundred and fifty.'

Kevin: 'Three hundred and fifty.
No it wasn't, it was three hundred.
It was two'

Paul: 'Yes it was.
Three hundred and fifty.'

Kevin: 'Oh anyway, it was still pretty good wasn't it?'

Paul: 'Wasn't cheap, I mean'

Kevin: 'No, but I mean you could see [UNK] play really well [UNK].
I mean Southgate's all the more pleasing when you think he's somebody that's worked his way up, right?'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'That's really nice to see.
And he played really well.'

Paul: 'Southgate is a harder person to mark isn't he?'

Kevin: 'Yeah.
I think I'd drop Mortimer oh look, Palace.
Red car it's like ours isn't it?'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'I'd drop, I'd drop Paul Mortimer'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'and have Collymore in right?
And encourage that's the trouble, you drop Mortimer you drop somebody who can er flip the ball in but I think you definitely want to take the heat off Wright.
Now if if all Collymore does is distract [UNK] but Mortimer was not playing enough of the game.
We can't afford people like Mortimer to, I mean he scored a goal [UNK] but I mean'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: '[UNK] Eddie [UNK] I think is worth [UNK] sheer sort of [UNK] opening teams up.
Well he does open, there's no not many players can play a team better like [UNK] than opening up [UNK]'

Paul: 'So what'd you do, say you had [UNK] back next week so our next game against Birmingham.
What would you do then?'

Kevin: 'Well I mean they've got, they've got, he's gotta do something because you're gonna lose that Birmingham game.
[UNK] can see that coming now.
But Birmingham must have won today cos they had equal top must have won I would have thought.'

Paul: 'That's good.'

Kevin: 'Chelsea won one nil.'

Paul: 'How do you know?'

Kevin: '[UNK] You'd have thought Forest would have beaten Chelsea wouldn't you? [UNK] really annoyed after being [UNK]'

Paul: 'Yeah.
I suppose so.
What are you gonna buy mum?'

Kevin: 'He's gone the whole hog that guy [UNK] hanging down to his'

Paul: 'Oh.
So what are you gonna buy her?
Newbury Fruits?
Or something like that, er'

Kevin: 'They did very well with those little tulip hand out [UNK] things didn't they?
There's a lot of people who er don't, who would not have gone to the bother of going into the shop and buying a one pound or two pound or four pound [UNK]'

Paul: 'But why did they do well out of them if they were free?'

Kevin: 'Well yeah they're free but they've got their advert on it haven't they? [UNK]'

Paul: 'Tulip'

Kevin: 'tulip tulip, I mean you're like a roving little advert aren't you?
I mean it, it draws your eye those little pictures doesn't it?
You [UNK]'

Paul: 'Oh he's got, he's got the hanging one at the front hasn't he?'

Kevin: 'And he's got a badge on the right hand side as well.'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'So he really is [UNK]'

Paul: 'You see that guy next to us?
He's got a Palace earring hasn't he? [UNK] on one of his ears.'

Kevin: 'Oh my goodness.'

Paul: 'On his left ear.'

Kevin: 'He's nice though isn't he, wasn't he, he did say something'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'I didn't have to say anything.
I said to him [UNK] I don't know, he said did you enjoy yourself Tuesday?
Oh I said, did you see us?
Oh yeah we saw you.
And his dad's nice.'

Paul: 'Yeah.
But that other bloke was there but he wasn't in his normal place.'

Kevin: 'Yes [UNK]'

Paul: 'Why wasn't he in his normal place?'

Kevin: 'Palace played really well.
The first twenty five minutes, when you think we were one nil up right I thought gosh if we could get that second goal it would have made all the difference and United would have been really would have been in trouble.'

## 017102

Paul: 'Was a good game though.'

Kevin: 'Oh I enjoyed it, yeah.
Just don't enjoy Palace losing, but [UNK] sheer football [UNK] and it just shows you that ironically the two games can match each other and there were chances for Palace to wrap that game up.
But er when they do play that ball to ball business erm'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'we look like we've got huge spaces in our in our midfield.
I mean that's what teams are doing now, they're realizing that's where all our weakness is in midfield so don't take a er a hefty boot and try and er er people like Thorn and I mean Thorn and Young were impeccably they played beautifully today.
You cannot ask Thorn and Young, I've never seen two players play they do, they did th, they do the simple thing but they do it consistently well.
Over and over again, maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty times in one match and they'll make one mistake and usually like Coleman was there to c, I think Coleman backed up well and Gareth [UNK] backed up well once or twice.
But defence wise superb.
Absolutely su, there was a lapse with that guy, don't know who was to blame about that third goal but I mean'

Paul: 'It was Young.
Er Young let it plop over [UNK]'

Kevin: 'Oh, didn't see who it was.
It was like, it was like a, like they were waiting for an offside or some there were just couldn't believe, it was'

Paul: 'But it was the same when Palace scored and exactly the same thing happened didn't it?
Why do they lapse?
It's weird.'

Kevin: 'Yeah, it's well they do say both sides that it's the most dangerous time straight after a goal.
I mean often, times you see teams equalize immediately.
You know it's like, you sometimes you can go a whole game like seventy minutes of a game and no-one's had a goal scoring chance'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'and then someone scores and the guy goes in straight calmly and scores straight away.
You know it's people aren't'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'I don't know, it's psychologically sort of still got their mind on going through what's er'

Paul: 'On what happened.'

Kevin: 'Yeah.'

Paul: 'It's like at school when they're thinking oh no, no and they've scored again.
It's like you've scored, you're so elated and you [UNK]'

Kevin: 'Fact you you often sort of watch videos of managers.
Managers are often shrieking you know about what's happening next rather than you know, all their players are jumping with joy all over each other and you think and they're saying get in your positions.
Do your stuff.
Don't let it slip straight away, I mean That was annoying thing is that we didn't deserve to lose three one really, I mean'

## 017103

Kevin: 'Sneak that that box of sweets in then for mum [UNK].'

Paul: 'I bet she knows you've done that for her.'

Kevin: 'Eh?'

Paul: 'I bet she knows you've bought that for her.'

Kevin: 'Well she knows that we're giving her something, yes.
I mean we could have been worse, could have forgotten completely.
I mean it's easy, cos when mum gets all those things for everybody else, clearly she doesn't get something for herself. [UNK]'

Paul: 'Don't know why not.
What did you get her last year?
It was the same thing wasn't it?'

Kevin: 'No I didn't get, we didn't do this did we, last year?'

Paul: 'Yes we did.
We always have the tree presents.'

Kevin: 'Do we?'

Paul: 'Our sunroof's pretty isn't it?'

Kevin: 'You what?'

Paul: 'Our sunroof's pretty isn't it?
Very stylish.'

Paul: 'What's the time?'

Kevin: 'This very busy road, isn't it?'

Paul: 'I suppose so.
[UNK] busier.'

Kevin: '[UNK] seems to be very busy [UNK]'

Paul: 'So does the other way.'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Paul: 'Because of mum.'

Kevin: '[UNK] where the heck are we.
[UNK] hundred percent better [UNK]'

Paul: 'Yeah you were well fluky then, getting the [UNK]'

Paul: 'How come that shop had them and the other one didn't?'

Kevin: '[UNK] you wouldn't believe it would you?'

Paul: 'No.'

Kevin: '[UNK] nice big posh shop like [UNK] and it's got cheap'

Paul: 'Yes.'

Kevin: 'and nasty [UNK] in it.'

Paul: 'Yes.
Hope you're enjoying it.'

Kevin: '[UNK] follow you up'

Paul: 'It would be real boring just listening to a load of rubbish wouldn't it?
I mean making up conversations all over the place.'

Kevin: 'Suddenly it clears this bit.'

Paul: 'What you're memory?'

Kevin: 'No this road.'

Paul: 'Oh, this road.
Why?'

Kevin: 'Dunno some go off that way'

Paul: 'I mean, let, some people go up go off where?
Where is it leading to?'

Kevin: 'Don't know.'

Paul: 'I don't really know.
What's all this, why does Meltis always have that stand of eighty, eighty years?'

Kevin: 'Well it's how long they've been going, I suppose. [UNK]'

Paul: 'Surely they've been [UNK] for the last four years and they must [UNK] or do they just keep it at eighty one then they go to ninety?'

Kevin: 'I don't know.
I've never noticed that badge before.'

Paul: 'Hallo how many miles have we done?'

Kevin: '[UNK] sixteen thousand one hundred and sixty.'

Paul: 'How many did we have when we bought it?
How long ago'

Kevin: 'Fourteen thousand'

Paul: 'how long ago was it that we bought it?'

Kevin: 'September.'

Paul: 'September?
Ages ago.'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: '[UNK] [UNK] twelve thousand miles [UNK]'

Paul: 'Twelve thousand?'

Paul: 'No way, not at eight.'

Kevin: 'What if we lose at Birmingham Paul.
Will you wanna go to the Chelsea match?'

Paul: 'What Chelsea match?'

Kevin: 'Well the Chelsea match is the following Tuesday.'

Paul: 'Is that [UNK] yes.
Yeah.'

Kevin: 'Yeah.
And what Saturd, what's the match on Saturday before squeezed in between that?'

Paul: 'What?
I don't really know.
Er erm is there a game on Saturday?'

Kevin: 'I think there might be.'

Paul: 'Oh I've got it, I've got it.
It's come to me.
It's come to me.
It's come to me.'

Kevin: 'Oh not a big team is it, again?'

Paul: 'Tottenham.'

Kevin: 'Oh no!'

Paul: '[UNK] Oh no it's not Tottenham.
No, you know when we played our Birmingham replay?'

Kevin: 'Yeah.'

Paul: 'That night we were gonna play Tottenham.'

Kevin: 'Were we?'

Paul: 'Mark [UNK] told me that.
It was on his picture list.'

Kevin: 'Really?'

Paul: 'That night we were gonna play Tottenham'

Kevin: 'Oh well.'

Paul: 'in the league.
Oh sorry.'

Kevin: 'Perhaps we can play Tottenham when they haven't got er Gary Lineker in their games any more.'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'You start hitting periods like this and you think oh no.
You think every team [UNK] you start worrying about almost every side don't you?'

Paul: 'Yeah.
Oh we always worry about every side cos Crystal Palace always hate the bad sides.
Cos usually we do well against the Man United and as soon as we start losing against them we start getting worried.'

Kevin: 'They outplayed us last season at fairground didn't they?
[UNK] Liverpool [UNK]'

Paul: 'What do you mean [UNK] at Liverpool?
What did Liverpool do to them then?'

Kevin: 'Well we lost no we beat them two one [UNK]'

Paul: 'Yeah.
I remember that.'

Kevin: 'Most surprising result of that season.'

Paul: 'Not really.
Was it?'

Kevin: 'It is when you see us struggling against Birmingham.'

Kevin: 'What do you think the score's gonna be against Birmingham?'

Paul: 'Three one to Palace.'

Kevin: 'Three one to Palace?
Be great if that is.'

Paul: 'We will score first.
They will equalize and we'll score two more.'

Kevin: 'We have got to get another goalgetter.
I mean old erm [UNK] does his bit [UNK] crossing and splitting defences and getting goals but not scoring them. [UNK]'

Paul: 'What do you mean, getting goals and then not'

Kevin: 'Now, well now [UNK] it's just now we've got nobody who, who score actually really scores goals except Thomas I would say at the moment.
We really do need somebody who regularly pops them in.'

Paul: 'What about Gabbiadini?
What about Gabiadini?'

Kevin: 'Well he's coming along.'

Paul: 'I don't see him [UNK]'

Kevin: 'I think he he had a really good first half I think it like, I think that to be fair, apart from Coleman an Southgate everybody faded in the second half didn't they? [UNK]'

Paul: 'Yo.
Yo [UNK]'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Paul: 'What's that, Man United fans?'

Paul: 'Wallington.
Where's Wallington?'

Paul: 'Oh that's boring.
Why are we going this way then?'

Kevin: 'Are, are Manchester United not the most cockiest fans going aren't they?
They really are cocky [UNK].'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'Leeds, I like Man United, I don't, I don't hate them or anything I just, they get a bit I dunno.
Mind you not that they've had an awful lot of success recently but they are, really are a cocky lot.
Leeds are aggressive so you're always quite glad that you've beaten them but [UNK].
Specially with Palace I think they seem to think [UNK] but they really [UNK].
Should have finished them off in that first [UNK]'

Paul: 'Yeah Can I just flick the light on for a second?
Thank you. [UNK]'

Kevin: 'Yes, see who I mean I can't think of anybody who's in the reserves who could do any better than the lot that are in, in at the moment.
Can you?
Other than perhaps give Colleymore a full blooded game, right?'

Paul: 'Doesn't he get a full blooded game at the moment?'

Kevin: 'I think perhaps it's, it's worth it now.
The season, I mean we're not gonna come top of the league are we?
Right?
We've gotta make sure we stay in the first division but'

Kevin: 'I think we can afford to blood Colimore as a good one now.
He could have this whole of this season to get used to playing, right?'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'And then who knows what fireworks could happen the season after.
I mean he's never gonna be a [UNK] when he's obviously another Bright. [UNK]'

Paul: 'Who wants another Bright?
We're supposed to [UNK] to the better style of play.'

Kevin: 'No, I don't know.'

Paul: 'Well why did we buy Gabiadini?
Why?
What would be the point of buying Gabiadini?'

Kevin: 'No, well I, I mean you saw the point really.
I mean to pick I mean who, who who could replace [UNK]?
He's, I, he, the way he plays is virtually unique, isn't he?
So I mean you're not gonna say [UNK] well let's go and get another Ian Wright off the peg so fair enough.
But er in the kind of situation where Ian Wright was very very good was in tight situations.
[UNK] differently through se sheer speed and but er I can see Gabiadini I mean Ian Wright never flicks like some of the flicks that he does.
I mean some of the flicks are fantastic.
But erm there is a nice side to his game but god he doesn't half fade.
Can you afford somebody that fades like that, I don't know it's'

Paul: 'The whole team fades at the moment.'

Kevin: 'I, I, that's what I would do.
I'd drop Mortimer now and er keep, I wouldn't, I'd keep McGoldrick up don't have him as a sweeper.
I mean if you're gonna have McGoldrick as a sweeper then you'd have to bring Mortimer back but'

Paul: 'Why not'

Kevin: '[UNK] I noticed it was quite odd that he didn't use McGoldrick as a sweeper did he?
I mean we, we went out to win that game didn't we, again?
Well, don't you think?'

Paul: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'We didn't play a [UNK] and yet the defence played well enough.
So I think drop Mortimer and bring Colimore in for a full ninety minutes and then and and again and again and again.
Get sort of like half a dozen games.'

Paul: 'I think drop Bright [UNK] Colimore.'

It was so strong'

Ruth: 'Why did you let him?'

Kevin: 'I put it in the boot.'

Ruth: 'Why did you let him?'

Kevin: 'I think it'll have to be put in the garage and then put in the car once a week or something.'

Ruth: 'Why did you let him do it?'

Kevin: 'I dunno.
Unsupervised as you would say.'

Ruth: 'You've got no control over him at all have you?'

Paul: 'Oh yeah mum wouldn't have done it would she?'

Kevin: 'You'd ripped the wrapper before'

Paul: 'We had the wrapper off last time.'

Ruth: 'No we didn't.'

Paul: 'Yes we did!'

Ruth: 'No, you pull it out a bit at a time, not just'

Paul: 'No, but we had it off last time.'

Kevin: 'Yeah the spice was was not nice.'

Paul: 'The spice wasn't half as nice as [UNK]'

Ruth: 'So it's it's totally wasted then is it?

Paul: 'It would have been disgusting anyway.'

Ruth: 'Is it totally wasted then?'

Paul: 'Yes.

Kevin: 'No well no it's usable.'

Paul: 'Absolutely fantastic wastage. [UNK]'

Kevin: '[UNK] Wimbledon got [UNK] got the right royal rave.

Paul: 'The white what rave?'

Paul: 'Oh I get it.

Kevin: 'Mm.'

Paul: 'Joe Royle?'

Kevin: '[UNK] yeah.'

Paul: 'Can I watch it, can I read it?'

Kevin: 'Eh?
No.

Paul: 'You're always reading it. [UNK]'

Kevin: 'Oh look you always get these people we have just witnessed the top London club suffering a humiliating defeat at the hands of [UNK].
Oh this looks good, let's see.
Is it horror?'

Paul: 'Don't know.'

Kevin: 'Now you'll see the goals on this, now.'

Kevin: 'Because it was on the other B B C one so it should be on this one as well.'

Paul: 'You saw them?'

Kevin: 'Yeah.
All four goals.'

Paul: 'When?'

## 017108

Kevin: 'Here's a letter that m mistakenly done today.
It says it says it now seems painfully obvious that after our performance at Forest we have reached the stage where teams have finally worked us out.
For some time we've been in a false position and our two games against Birmingham have confirmed this.
Dunno why they're saying this bit.
Steve [UNK] may explain the game at Saint Andrews was for low to ground players.
Don't [UNK] well they.
But surely by now we have a squad to deal with such eventualities.
We have clearly lost our way in both fullback positions.
Well that wasn't true today.
Our two fullbacks played the best of the Palace players, I thought.
Both were, couldn't been asked any more of.
Both saved instant goals.
Er both got feet in just as goals were about to be shot and scored.
This is er ob now obvious after it's aft as it is restricting our attacking options.
What possible reason is there for not playing Bodin?
A proven player of international quality who enjoys going forward.
We are told that we have to pay Swindon another fifty thousand if he plays.
But if we went out of the cup it could cost us more in lost revenue.
Come clean Steve.
Swallow your pride.
Play Bodin in the position you bought him for and show off our defence that otherwise will leak goals like two seasons ago.
It's not true.
Bodin's I don't reckon's as good a defender as that.
He's a good passer of the ball [UNK] have him in the middle.'

Paul: 'Well where then?'

Kevin: 'Dunno.
Well we cou, he might be able to use him if Thomas can't play erm on Tuesday.
I can well believe Thomas won't be fit for Tuesday now.
Not after ricking his ankle like that.
If his ankle's any, half as bad as mine he wouldn't play on Tuesday.'

Paul: 'I chose the right Tuesday to go then didn't I?
It wouldn't be very good without Jeff Thomas there would it?'

Kevin: 'No.'

Paul: 'Who do you reckon will be captain then?'

Ruth: 'He's gonna have steroids for it.'

Paul: 'Who'd be captain?'

Kevin: 'Pardon Ruth.'

Ruth: 'He's gonna have steroid injections in his'

Paul: 'Ankle.'

Kevin: 'You mean steroid, do you?'

Ruth: 'Yeah.'

Paul: 'She does.'

Ruth: 'I do, I think.'

Kevin: 'Aha.
What they, what they deflate your swelling quicker do they?'

Ruth: 'Yeah.'

Paul: 'Yeah who would er be the captain?'

Kevin: 'Humphreys isn't it?'

Paul: 'He's not playing.
I suppose Young would be wouldn't he?'

Kevin: '[UNK] Thorn Thorn's been captain before now as well hasn't he?
Thorn and Young!
Couldn't cr er complain about that.
It didn't look like, you have a look at this goal.
Didn't look like Young's problem.
Put a tape in Paulie just in get a tape quick.
And see if we can tape this th th th last time they showed all four goals.
Clearly B B C'

Paul: 'I see, No.
Is this on I T V separate?
Are you there?
Are ready to record straight away, bumph with the record button?'

Kevin: 'Just a minute.'

## 017201

Ruth: 'Yeah but you're supposed to listen to it all off and see.'

Kevin: 'Oh no [UNK] ridiculous isn't it!'

Ruth: 'Well no so they can identify the people, isn't it.'

Kevin: 'Yeah but then yo er in a party situation you could probably do that in the first minutes couldn't you, I would have thought everybody in th room will have spoken in the first five minutes wouldn't they?'

Ruth: 'So I've just gotta jot it down quickly then.'

Kevin: 'Yeah Oh we've got more [UNK] this time'

Ruth: 'Yeah well when I saw Alison's lo the flan recipes, I panicked.'

Ruth: 'What do you want the little one for?'

Kevin: 'You said the black knife, you said.'

Ruth: 'I said the sharp one this one he's fairly cheap but they use him a lot, [UNK] [UNK].'

Kevin: 'Alright and don't burn them then.'

Ruth: 'I think they burn very easy Do you think everyone will dress up today?
Don't cut them completely in half like that.'

Kevin: 'Well I have.'

Ruth: 'Well, oh best if you cut them almost to the end like that then butter them and stick them back together again Have I got that cream?
I've sort of forgot about the puddings there's blackcurrant torte up there, can you see?

Kevin: 'Ooh yeah!'

Ruth: 'No it's funny unle I Mum says is it something that's just been published this year you know, like if someone just published [UNK]'

Kevin: 'No.'

Ruth: 'and everyone jumped on the bandwagon, or have they all made up their own?'

Kevin: 'That is the whole point of rap they're completely personal it's a personal rap.'

Ruth: 'Well Michael says you haven't been to a decent service for six weeks, till [UNK] back.
So we went so and so, that was dreadful!
We went so and so, that was dreadful!'

Kevin: '[UNK] can put your finger on it though, it it's like it's not what it used to be.'

Ruth: 'That's it well tha [UNK] there's Peggy says I said oh well I'm a bit erm worried about taking them and I said they have been known to get up and walk out, and [UNK] said, surely not!

Joy: 'Yes it's a walkie talkie.'

Paul: 'Oh that's a good one.'

[UNK]: 'I think mine was [UNK].'

Adrian: 'You got that from [UNK]'

Kevin: 'You got walkie talkie out of that?'

Paul: '[UNK] quite good.'

Adrian: 'You see I was doing [UNK]'

Joy: 'I don't yes it's got the earphones and'

Ruth: 'That's not a walkie talkie that's a walkie talkie.'

Paul: 'Let's see.'

Eric: 'Yeah, it's not bad.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Paul: 'What's I can't even see, hang on'

Kevin: 'You got walkie talkie from a Sony Walkman there.'

Michelle: '[UNK] what they're talking about.'

Ruth: 'Anyway they get a go now [UNK].'

Kevin: 'There's fifty years of empathy [UNK]'

Ruth: 'Surely they won so they [UNK]?'

Paul: 'No.
[UNK]. They have, they have to have their go.'

[UNK]: 'What?'

Michelle: '[UNK] move that.'

Paul: 'They have to go.
They can't move.
Now if they win this one'

Kevin: 'Yes that's right.'

Paul: 'on their own one then they get a well done.'

Joy: '[UNK] but we can't get off of there unless we'

Eric: 'We can't get off it.'

Paul: 'You can if you win this.'

Kevin: 'If you win this'

Joy: 'Yeah'

Paul: 'If it's on it's own.'

Kevin: 'That's, you have to keep [UNK]'

Adrian: 'You're on your own now though.'

Joy: 'Well how, what advantage was it to him to win that then?'

Eric: 'Well I'

Paul: 'You see he's so unlucky that his is on all play.'

Kevin: 'Hang on [UNK]'

Ruth: 'Right.
There you are.'

Eric: 'Well lets just test that out because I'm I'm suffering enough.
I've been suffering'

Eric: 'Ever since the game started you'

Kevin: 'You're suffering, she's wet!'

Paul: 'This time we'll do it.
Next time he can move if he wins it.
After that, afterwards.'

Joy: 'Yeah but every time we have an all play.
Whatever happens.'

Kevin: 'Yes I that that does seem a bit odd.'

Paul: 'Okay next time we'll move.'

Adrian: 'All [UNK] all play. [UNK]'

Eric: 'Yeah read all play for goodness sake.'

Adrian: 'In the all play category the word card is shown to the picturist of each team.
The all play word is sketched simultaneously by picturists in their respective teams at the start [UNK]'

Adrian: 'Regardless of who's all play it was, the first team to identify the word earns control of the die and immediately rolls and advances the number of squares indicated.
The team now continues in turn with a new word.
If no team identifies the word in the time allotted the die is passed to the left.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Adrian: 'However the team does not roll the die but begins its turn by pulling a new card and sketching the word corresponding [UNK]'

Paul: 'What does that mean?'

Ruth: 'So why is there no advantage to them to have guessed walkie talkie?'

Eric: 'I mean I've won the game.
I mu'

Paul: '[UNK] an all play.'

Michelle: '[UNK] advantage because it's all play.
You could have been the next player [UNK]'

Paul: 'If he was [UNK]'

Eric: 'We'll never get off all play then?'

Joy: '[UNK] all of theirs er'

Michelle: 'Yes you will.
It's you've got to be first to find it.'

Paul: 'Yes!
You've got there's your disadvantage.
Yes.'

Ruth: 'It's just bad luck that you happen to be stuck on [UNK].'

Paul: 'Just bad luck.'

Kevin: 'You're right.
It's not [UNK]'

Eric: 'We've [UNK] since the game begun.'

Ruth: 'All play.'

Eric: 'What is it does it say?'

Ruth: 'All play.'

Paul: 'No.
Next time you [UNK] next time they can roll the dice if they get it. [UNK]'

Michelle: 'She's going to give it to Joy.'

Eric: 'All play.'

Joy: 'What is it?
All play.
What is it?
What an action or'

Kevin: 'Who's who's go?
Who who's drawing for you?'

Adrian: 'Michelle.'

Michelle: 'Yeah.'

Paul: 'It's reds yeah, but it hard?
How many words?
Remember short words or long words.'

Ruth: 'Ready go.'

Paul: 'How many words?

Joy: '[UNK] it seems to me we have to win two to get off.'

Ruth: 'Collar.
Neck.
Tie.'

[UNK]: 'Oh she's got'

Ruth: 'Brooch.
Collar.
Necktie.'

Paul: 'Er bow tie.'

Michelle: 'Short necked.
Rolo neck.'

Paul: 'Er collar.'

Ruth: 'Polo neck.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah. [UNK]'

Eric: 'Polo neck.
I'm drawing a polo horse and you're going look I've done the collar, polo.'

Paul: 'I was trying to remember the name of that collar.
I said oh what's it called.'

Ruth: 'I don't throw the dice do I?'

Eric: 'Well why not say polo?'

Ruth: 'Right so we're on there'

Eric: 'We'll never, we'll never get off.'

Joy: 'We've got to get twice to get off.'

Eric: 'We've got to win twice to get off'

Kevin: 'Yes.
You've got to you've got to win twice to get off.
I think'

Eric: 'Never get on a red.'

Kevin: 'No.'

Ruth: 'Everybody does this one.'

Eric: 'If you get stuck on a red you've had it.'

Kevin: 'It's a bugger of a square to get on, that one.'

Paul: 'What are we on?
Brown?'

Eric: 'It's a terrible square to get on mum.'

Kevin: 'I think the rule should be you should move on soon as you win one, I think.'

Paul: 'Oh that's easy.'

Ruth: 'Do you wanna take a card out?'

Joy: 'I don't think that's quite right'

Paul: 'This is a quick one.
A quick one.'

Eric: 'I'm sure you're supposed to go two'

Paul: 'Well Paul that's not fair.
If mother hasn't even seen it.'

Paul: 'I know.
I know.
[UNK] to say, it's a quick one.'

Eric: 'I can't think [UNK]'

Ruth: '[UNK] brown'

Eric: 'because you're on all play you're stuck there forever.'

Ruth: 'Right.'

Kevin: 'What's what's that behind over there?
That that over there?
This, that bit there.'

Paul: 'Well don't look.
Don't look.'

Ruth: 'Red now.'

[UNK]: 'Ready steady go.'

Kevin: 'What's that?'

Michelle: 'One word.'

Kevin: 'Erm volcano'

Eric: 'Vesuvius'

[UNK]: 'Volcano.
Eruption.'

Paul: 'Yes.'

Eric: 'Lava.
What was it?'

[UNK]: 'Erupt.'

Ruth: 'I don't think they should be allowed that.'

Paul: 'What?'

Kevin: 'Why?'

Ruth: 'It was erupt.
And as you are winning by so much I think we should [UNK]'

Kevin: 'Oh no no no eruption, erupt is alright.'

Paul: 'Oh come on.
That's not fair.'

Eric: 'What did you say then?'

Paul: 'Because we're given them.'

Kevin: 'Yeah yeah.
Yeah I think'

Adrian: 'How precise an answer must be is up to the teams playing.'

Kevin: 'Yeah.'

Adrian: 'Should be decided at the start of the game.
For example is bunk bed is bunk acceptable for bunk bed?'

Paul: 'Yes.'

Kevin: 'No'

Ruth: 'Depends whether you're winning by half a board or not..'

Adrian: 'Thatcher for Margaret Thatcher.
Enlarged or enlarge.'

Paul: 'No it doesn't.'

Ruth: 'Yeah.
Alright.'

Kevin: 'Yes.
I think it is. [UNK]'

Ruth: 'Go on then.
Your turn.
Blue.'

Paul: 'Hang on.
Can can I just raise a rule?'

Ruth: 'What?'

Paul: 'If they win an all play on somebody else's they are immediately allowed to roll the dice and they won't stay'

Michelle: '[UNK] for two.'

Paul: 'on all play.
So they can get off all play.
And then [UNK]'

Ruth: 'Do you mean you want to change the rule?'

Paul: 'No no.'

Joy: 'You've got to agree in at least'

Eric: 'I'm sure that rule is wrong about being on all play.'

Paul: 'If we have another all play'

Adrian: '[UNK] If a word is not identified in the time limit the die is passed to the left.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Adrian: 'The team receiving the die begins its turn by pulling a new card from the pack'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Adrian: 'not a roll of the die.'

Ruth: 'That's right.'

Kevin: 'Quite clearly you can't roll the dice the first time you win.'

Eric: 'Well it's just one of those unlucky things.'

Adrian: 'The only times the die is rolled to advance the token is when a word is identified within the one minute time limit'

Ruth: 'Yes.
And you have another go.
Yeah?'

Adrian: 'or the team is first to identify the word in any hang on, hang on the only the time the die is rolled to advance the token is when a word is identified within the one minute time limit comma or a team is first to identify the word in any all play situation.'

Kevin: 'Ah.
Yes.'

Eric: 'Oh well we did that.'

Joy: 'We've been, twice we've had it.'

Eric: 'We should have had twice we've'

Kevin: 'Yeah.'

Ruth: 'I tell you what, you can have two rolls of the dice.
Give them the dice.'

Kevin: 'Right.'

Ruth: 'Right.'

Eric: 'Yes.
I thought it was wrong.'

Kevin: 'Mum thought it was wrong.'

Paul: 'No but it's still our go.
It's still our go.'

Ruth: 'And another.
It isn't it's five'

[UNK]: 'Five.'

Paul: 'Yes it is.
It's still our go cos we won it.'

Joy: 'One two three four five.'

Ruth: '[UNK] your go you have to pick a blue.
Who's drawing?'

Eric: 'That's better.'

Paul: '[UNK] me.
Me.'

Eric: 'Now what do we do in future?
When you win one'

Ruth: 'No.
You haven't got a blue.'

Kevin: 'If you're in an all play situation you can move on straight away.'

Paul: 'Can we [UNK]?
Can we [UNK]?'

Adrian: 'It's me to draw.'

Paul: 'What?'

Adrian: 'You did the volcano.'

Ruth: 'You to draw.'

Michelle: 'You did the volcano.'

Paul: 'Oh yeah.
Yeah.'

Eric: 'We'd have been there forever.'

Ruth: 'Michelle to draw.'

Kevin: 'You're right and wrong [UNK]'

Michelle: 'You did the er Oh no yes it's you to draw.'

Paul: 'Yes [UNK]'

Eric: 'Still I think we done fair by giving two rolls of the dice.'

Kevin: 'Have you looked at it?
Oh I've got to see it.'

Paul: 'No.
I haven't seen it.'

Kevin: 'Is that it, the card?'

Ruth: 'It's not all play.'

Kevin: 'Oh.'

Ruth: 'A Andy's got [UNK] it's just a blue one.'

Paul: 'Did we roll our dice?
Did we roll our dice?'

Ruth: 'are you on your own?'

Adrian: 'Mhm.

Ruth: 'No you don't roll it.'

Paul: 'Yes why not?'

Michelle: 'We didn't have to roll [UNK]'

Ruth: 'You haven't got control.'

Adrian: 'Oh yes.'

Eric: 'You haven't got control.'

Ruth: 'We won that eruption.'

Paul: 'Yes.'

Ruth: 'But it was their go'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Ruth: 'so you haven't got control.'

Paul: 'Why was it their go?'

Michelle: 'Because they were on all play.'

Ruth: 'Because it was an all play, for them.'

Adrian: 'Blue is it have I [UNK] blue?'

Three or more it will be all play and if we win it we've won the game.'

[UNK]: 'Right.'

Adrian: 'A team that reaches the final all play square cannot win the game by winning a round controlled by another team.

Eric: 'I thought you used your hand, bongo drums.'

Paul: 'So it's their turn?'

Kevin: 'Yeah.'

Ruth: 'It's your turn and if they [UNK] all play then we all play.'

Kevin: 'I was doing sticks I must admit.
I can't draw hands.'

Michelle: 'It's an all play this one [UNK]?'

Ruth: 'I dunno, has it got an arrow on it?
D O, the blue one?'

Paul: 'Has it got an arrow?'

Eric: 'Oh.

Paul: 'Don't don't shut [UNK]'

Eric: 'A black arrow.'

Joy: 'Er yes.'

Eric: 'It has.
It's all play then.'

Paul: 'It has.
So we can't win if we get this.'

Kevin: 'We can't win.'

Paul: 'We've just got to get control then we can win.'

Kevin: 'Yeah.'

Eric: 'Yeah.'

Paul: 'Go on.

Paul: 'It's only one year difference is it?'

Kevin: 'You'll find that'

Ruth: 'No one wants to move down one.'

Kevin: 'Yeah, but you'll find that when the people will get threaten with their job loses they do everything, do anything.'

Ruth: 'Oh I won't.'

Paul: 'Well you want to keep searching.'

Ruth: 'I don't mind teaching one year though, but nobody else wants to move down, I move down and Liz moves down that's this places Jo [UNK] erm, Jan [UNK] they won't want to move down, they move down that [UNK] the next two, they don't wanna move, Terry [UNK] doesn't want to go down any lower'

Kevin: 'In the [UNK] right'

Ruth: 'He's been doing it for twenty years'

Kevin: 'picks up the phone not knowing who it is and says Santa's Grotto it is funny isn't it?'

Kevin: 'but as mummy says it's not what a respectable headmaster is supposed to do is it?'

Paul: 'He [UNK] laugh it.'

Ruth: 'Well, I tell you something all the children in my class have got perfect [UNK] as near as your gonna get.'

Ruth: 'He just hasn't got a clue, apparently he said last night he never thought it would be so hard, he had a confession with Liz or something, never thought it would be so hard and he's really struggled this year, really, really hard work, nothing like being a deputy which to me he's an idiot if he didn't know that, he's feeling guilty about the phone bill, but [UNK] hasn't got any money at all for anything'

Kevin: 'But then I, I, it's unfortunate that you had your first I mean someone who had no experience of headmastership, head, head teachers, I mean all the head teachers I should think are in financial problems this year cos it's really there first full year'

Ruth: 'Yeah'

Kevin: 'isn't it?, right, but I mean, he has, he's had other problems to compound it and distract it'

Ruth: 'yeah'

Kevin: 'and he's made it probably an even worse hash than, than the average teacher'

Ruth: 'He just can't manage money, full stop.'

Kevin: 'I mean he's a, he's got to a, he's got to be a claim all across the whole sitting is that the, that their budgeting is not enough is it?'

Ruth: 'Yeah, but'

Paul: 'Mum, mum'

Ruth: 'What?'

Paul: 'why do [UNK] these things, you've done it, why [UNK] library [UNK]'

Ruth: 'Paul [UNK]'

Paul: 'It is.'

Ruth: 'The books have been stolen at the rate of twenty or thirty a day.'

Paul: 'That's his fault, is it?, it's the teachers fault'

Kevin: 'Is that really true or is that an exaggeration?'

Ruth: 'Look at the shelves'

Kevin: 'Think about it, is it twenty or thirty a day?'

Ruth: 'Yes, he came into the hall the other day and he tipped out'

Kevin: 'Well he only asked, I mean that's obvious that he can say children'

Ruth: 'he tipped out a pile of library tickets onto the thing and it was, it was a, it was, must of been, it was hundreds'

Paul: 'Yeah, what [UNK]'

Ruth: 'And he said this is a month, this was a month after the end of term, [UNK] this, can't find books for any of these tickets, they're not in any children's'

Paul: 'Well he borrowed'

Paul: 'the books for [UNK] didn't he?'

Ruth: 'No.'

Paul: 'He checked, who checked up'

Ruth: 'They're not found in the library, all the loose tickets, a mountain of them, surely you just take the tickets out and shut the book.'

Kevin: 'But then if it's twenty or thirty it stands to reason that's probably about the same'

Ruth: '[UNK] household'

Kevin: 'the same children stealing them'

Ruth: 'yeah'

Kevin: 'every day, well why'

Ruth: 'yeah'

Kevin: 'don't you clamped down on these kids?'

Ruth: 'Well, we've tried.
When a child came in this morning, the one I, that we accused of taking that out, he said he didn't take it, I went on and on and on, he said he didn't take it, I said I want a letter from your father to say that you bought it then, that doesn't mean anything, the father could lie.'

Paul: 'Why did you ask for?'

Kevin: 'The point is you don't do these children any service by letting them getting away with it, cos they think they can get away with it.'

Ruth: 'What can you do?
You can't prove they did it'

Paul: 'It does sound quite good if you give them, I suppose for math tuition [UNK] probably sat twenty five to [UNK].'

Ruth: 'Why you're doing this Christmas, it may be my last, John said what do you mean, I said well, I don't know if I'm going to be in a classroom this time next year, I mean, I really enjoy Christmas with the children, fifteen years since I've done it, I've forgotten how I enjoyed myself.'
