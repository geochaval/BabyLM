Patrick: 'Oh I think I've thrown it away.'

Katherine: 'Oh come on.'

Patrick: 'It was in yesterday's paper it's already in the kitchen.'

Katherine: 'Can you tell me everything or or should I read it?'

Patrick: 'They can now put a television camera into your stomach.'

Katherine: 'Really?'

Patrick: 'And into your veins I think.'

Katherine: 'And in everybody's house what?
Oh yes and then ah here's a blue tit look there you see, and then where does it connect up, it doesn't happen.'

Stefan: 'No, never.'

Katherine: 'Where?'

Katherine: 'I see, well [UNK].'

Stefan: 'I know, because you know, it's not very [UNK].'

Stefan: 'So, so the [UNK] aren't doing here.'

Katherine: 'Well fair enough, but [UNK].'

Katherine: 'I'd rather have a meal [UNK] wouldn't you?'

Stefan: 'I wonder now, or is, I'm not sure any more, but I think she is.'

Katherine: 'Why do you think so?

Stefan: 'Yes, but I think she is Swiss.'

Katherine: 'Is she?'

Stefan: 'I'm not sure though, I'm not sure.'

Katherine: 'She's a very old lady, distinguished looking.'

Stefan: 'Very old lady, yes.'

Katherine: 'Well have you seen her?'

Stefan: 'N I have worked with her on, she is responsible for some artist to do in Belgium and I needed some information on some artist who worked, that was at the time when I was doing eh, P R campaigns for er, Sheba, the cat product, and we needed [UNK].'

Stefan: 'We needed artist who were painting cats.'

Katherine: 'Aha.'

Stefan: 'And she had, she was responsible, I mean she was er, representative for two of the paintings in Belgium so that's why I'm [UNK].'

Katherine: 'Yes, so you're painting cats?'

Stefan: 'Yes. [UNK]'

Stefan: 'Yes.
All two, all the two of them.'

Katherine: 'Oh, yes. [UNK].'

Stefan: 'Yes.'

Katherine: 'So, look, I have to hid it from Patrick otherwise he will eat them all. [UNK].'

Stefan: 'Well he has [UNK] to eat.'

Katherine: '[UNK].

Stefan: 'Nine thirty.'

Katherine: 'Not all day?
Three hours?'

Stefan: 'Three hours.'

Katherine: 'That's it.'

Stefan: 'From nine thirty until half past twelve.
The little [UNK] analysis and communication board.'

Katherine: 'Oh my grief.'

Katherine: 'How many [UNK], maybe that [UNK] simple, very simple [UNK] eh?'

Katherine: 'And what is it really?
What is meant by that?'

Stefan: 'It is, about comparing political, sociological, economic novels.'

Katherine: 'Well, what do you mean [UNK]?'

Stefan: 'Great communications, great [UNK].
How can you compare, how can you apply pluralism, imperialism.'

Katherine: 'Oh my god, can't you really find [UNK].
Which is?'

Stefan: '[UNK].
[UNK] or a corporate system, how can they apply to communications?'

Katherine: 'I still don't know any [UNK].'

Stefan: 'Okay, so, [UNK].'

Katherine: 'Give me an example.'

Stefan: 'Erm, alright.'

Stefan: 'For example, when you talk of, imperialism, when you look at, when we, we've study it from a [UNK], erm, quite a few, so it means that [UNK] that capitalism [UNK] supply'

Stefan: 'and, but the problem is, that, although it creates supply it laboured people who worked, yeah'

Katherine: 'Yeah.'

Stefan: 'cannot buy it because it's too expensive for them.
So capitalism has to export it over its boundary and that's one of the company, what you could call it period, for example, erm'

Katherine: 'I see.'

Stefan: 'Let's'

Katherine: 'Maybe become export, become [UNK] does it?'

Stefan: 'Alright, let's see the French, mm, mm, mm, yes.'

Katherine: 'Well [UNK].'

Stefan: 'So for example, I don't know, erm, [UNK], let's take an example, [UNK], [UNK], the French, erm multinational, tele telecommunications'

Katherine: 'Yeah.'

Stefan: 'National.'

Katherine: 'Do you know [UNK], you will find here, that they say [UNK].'

Katherine: 'Yeah, so you better [UNK] if you have [UNK].'

Stefan: 'I haven't [UNK].'

Katherine: 'You don't, okay.'

Stefan: 'Multinationals, they have erm, [UNK], doing much better abroad than it is doing in France.'

Katherine: 'Okay, well [UNK].'

Stefan: 'Because the French cannot always buy what [UNK]'

Katherine: 'Alright, alright.'

Stefan: 'so that's why it's only period.'

Stefan: 'Well you can call it export too, but export is [UNK].'

Stefan: 'That means imperialism means in a way they're the French market it's well known, and, makes itself sell at much a [UNK] than in its, in its own country, so you can say that for example Thompson has a monopoly tower, most European and [UNK] have a monopoly tower'

Katherine: 'Yes.'

Stefan: 'in not only Holland but in Germany.'

Katherine: 'Yes, quite.'

Stefan: 'Belgium'

Katherine: 'Yes, yes.'

Stefan: 'And so when you, so it means that the Dutch are leaders, so it's, it's kind of, that's how putting up the communications empire [UNK].
In Holland that the empire is broader than Belgium is.'

Katherine: 'Mm, mm.'

Stefan: 'Broader than all over Europe.'

Katherine: 'Mm.'

Stefan: 'That's why it's called imperialism.'

Katherine: 'Ah yes.'

Stefan: 'So it becomes in fact a telecommunication empire.'

Katherine: 'Yeah, it's really, it, it is the power not they're exporting.'

Stefan: 'Yeah.'

Katherine: 'Yeah.'

Stefan: 'The power.'

Katherine: 'It's more than [UNK].'

Stefan: 'Yes.'

Katherine: 'Logical side of, of [UNK].'

Stefan: 'Yeah, yeah.'

Katherine: 'Now, alright, that's imperialism yes.
What, what's the other?
Eh, multinational.
They do a bit of imperialism.'

Katherine: '[UNK], they are easy aren't they?'

Stefan: 'And then erm'

Katherine: '[UNK] Brussels.

They're a big company in Brussels [UNK], and they got, they got their office where they like [UNK].
And now they're gone.'

Stefan: 'Aha.'

Katherine: 'Well you really [UNK].'

Katherine: 'Yes, you mix it up [UNK].'

Stefan: 'No, no.'

Katherine: 'Really, no.'

Stefan: 'No, it's quite a [UNK] apart.'

Katherine: 'I [UNK] at once, Stefan, there was an [UNK], I was [UNK] anything, just [UNK].
So a lawyer came, and of course I had my own office [UNK], confidential stuff, so he wanted to give it to me.
[UNK], and [UNK] in the machine or something, I had [UNK] you know, I never know, you have quite a few words which aren't any French or [UNK].'

Katherine: '[UNK] one language, one [UNK] and the others have two or two [UNK].'

Katherine: 'Or else, I [UNK].

Katherine: '[UNK] stop there for tonight, but I had [UNK] you know, I just spoke French.'

Katherine: 'I just didn't open my mouth, but I understood what they said and they didn't know [UNK].
You know, and so, so the second time, the second day I could say one or two words and the third a little bit more, but eh that's it.'

Stefan: 'Same when I'm, when I'm in Italy, I, I can't speak Italian very well, but when I'm there a week, I pick up words very quickly and although I know my grammar isn't perfect, I can form sentences in a way that people do understand me, [UNK].'

Katherine: 'Yes.
Yes.'

Stefan: 'I, that, for me the hardest thing to do is example is study Spanish.'

Katherine: 'Yeah.'

Stefan: 'Because as I heard my mother speak Italian all the time and my cousins, you really ca can in my, you know in your [UNK]'

Katherine: 'Yes.
Your sub conscience, yeah.'

Stefan: 'You'll pick it up.'

Katherine: 'Did you?'

Stefan: 'And when I had to speak, I spoke Italian.'

Katherine: 'Did you?

Stefan: 'Yeah, yeah.'

Katherine: 'And eh, Julia and [UNK] and eh Ruth and her husband [UNK], eh went to Madrid and I stayed with Isobel.'

Stefan: 'Mm, mm.'

Katherine: 'Yeah.'

Stefan: 'He always, well we not always [UNK] often, very often, spoke Dutch with each other.'

Katherine: 'Did you?'

Stefan: 'Yes, because of, we were in school together in Dutch and on the way home we were with Dutch friends, so we [UNK] then, and we mostly spoke Dutch and now, since I, so it's nearly, since now seven years have been, since I have gone to States, first year in eighty three, came back in eighty four, and since then we've never, ever spoke Dutch.'

Katherine: 'Really, I think it'

Stefan: 'But now it'

Katherine: 'Shouldn't allow it, I, I always knew what it meant [UNK].'

Katherine: 'And, that, you make me think of it, suddenly she'd switched.'

Katherine: 'For what happened she can do it because, so okay, let's hope it's going to be nice.

Katherine: 'Sweet, isn't it?'

Stefan: 'It's very nice with the plants on.'

Stefan: 'They were all kind of silk covers with the [UNK] painting in the middle'

Katherine: 'Huh huh'

Stefan: 'and the they cost at that time the Swatch costed about one thousand three hundred thousand francs and they costed about two thousand eight hundred I think'

Katherine: 'I have seen just bigger ones black but very'

Katherine: 'Which are very expensive but not forty one'

Stefan: 'At Easter time yes I bought it at Easter time'

Katherine: 'Ah you've got it?'

Katherine: 'And the men [UNK] the woman as'

Stefan: 'Mm mm yes'

Katherine: 'Have you seen [UNK] yeah?'

Stefan: 'Yes'

Katherine: 'Yes?

Stefan: 'Yeah'

Katherine: 'But'

Stefan: 'and the one's [UNK] too late I like that one too and I wanted to buy it as'

Katherine: 'I've never seen do you think every country gets different ones?'

Stefan: 'Yes no well some countries don't get'

Katherine: 'all'

Katherine: 'Do you really think it's that much money'

Stefan: 'No.'

Katherine: 'You would get it?'

Stefan: 'I would never give that.'

Katherine: 'But do you think someone will pay that?'

Stefan: 'I don't I don't know.
I have no idea.'

Katherine: ''TIS nice'

Stefan: ''tis maybe over estimated too'

Katherine: 'I see yeah'

Stefan: 'Ya so that if the [UNK] goes up to thirty thousand the reserve might be large enough to give it to sell it for that price.
For example sometimes they overestimate certain works of art and you wonder you know during the sale you see it's estimated forty to fifty thousand so you think they'll never give it to you for less.
Sometimes a [UNK] gets up to thirty and then they give it to the person'

Katherine: 'Yeah it depends'

Stefan: 'Then one wonders why.
It's just because or they over estimated it or it's the price you know'

Katherine: 'They wanted to get'

Stefan: 'They wanted to get'

Katherine: 'Yeah yeah'

Stefan: 'It's'

Katherine: 'Yes well my dear look next time I have all again'

We had to have solved so much problems and I just this way and I just wouldn't have it you know it's just impossible it's impossible and I hummed and hawed which way and hummed and hawed which way.
In the end it must have been the right one because I was the best of all and I you know until five minutes before everything finished I just couldn't make up my mind'

Stefan: 'Hmm hmm'

Katherine: 'So er I was just lucky'
