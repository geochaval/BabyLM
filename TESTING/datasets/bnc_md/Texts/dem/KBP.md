[UNK]: 'and you switch it on before they arrive.'

Lil: 'Yes.
Mm.'

Clarence: 'Yes, exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But no it, it doesn't bother me.
I don't mind you know on camera, I don't mind being on video, anything.'

Lil: 'But in fairness to your friends Larry, you can hardly'

Clarence: 'Warts and all.'

Nev: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Oh no no.'

Lil: 'do that and then'

Clarence: 'I know'

Nev: 'You've got'

Clarence: 'I can't see Mike and Robin making a cake [UNK], can you?'

Nina: 'No.
No but'

Clarence: 'Not [UNK], no no no.
[UNK] Robin necessarily but just [UNK] temperaments [UNK]'

Nina: 'I don't know but well I remember going out shopping and when I came back you'd got'

Clarence: 'Jill.'

Nina: 'you'd gone out.
No they were, they were all of them there.'

Clarence: 'Were they?'

Nina: 'Nan and I were out shopping.
When we got back'

Clarence: 'Mm?'

Nina: 'it was christmas shopping I think.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Anyway you'd been out and bought one of those m packets of m cake mix.'

Clarence: 'Oh it would be ready mixed, yes.'

Nina: 'Well and they'd made little buns.
They were very nice really.'

Clarence: 'Oh it's a tribute to the'

Nina: 'The state of the kitchen wasn't.'

Clarence: 'Well that'll be a tribute to the manufacturer, sure.
Mm well I rem'

Nina: 'And Robin and L and erm Carol doing that er cabbage cabbage'

Clarence: 'Oh that revolting'

Nina: 'That was horrible.'

Clarence: 'That was terrible.
I remember Jill though.
I don't remember the mix but mm I don't know that, I vaguely remember now, yes but'

Nina: 'Oh they were all there'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'because we'd gone out, I think it was the christmas shopping we were doing on our own.'

Clarence: 'Was it?'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Yes I've got a hazy recollection but [UNK].
Mm.
Jill'll remember.
But she was a lot younger surely, Jill?
And she'd be a bit'

Nina: 'Oh she'd be young, erm'

Clarence: 'Younger than them I mean.'

Nina: 'They weren't, oh they were younger than Carol Caroline and erm Ken.'

Clarence: 'Mm mm mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'But then look at Chris.
He must have been interested in cooking, mustn't he?'

Clarence: 'I don't [UNK] Chris'

Nina: 'No I think the young fellows today are more because of course they go into the flats don't they?'

Clarence: 'Mm well that's true of course.'

Nina: 'I remember when Mike and Robin went into their flats I spent quite a long time with them'

Clarence: 'Yeah I know.
Mm.
Mm.
Mhm.'

Nina: 'Showing them how to do simple dishes.'

Clarence: 'Mhm.
But erm quite frankly I can't see myself ever getting given the same sort of circumstances.'

Nina: 'Well n no.'

Nina: 'I can't either.
Knowing you I no it's laughable.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.'

Nina: 'Can't imagine you meeting me with a nice cooked dinner and a a cake made by yo your own fair'

Clarence: '[UNK] No I'

Nina: 'with a candle on.'

Clarence: 'No.
Use a soldering iron or a blow lamp or something, not'

Nina: 'Burnt toast.'

Clarence: 'Ah no, it's not really burnt, it's the way I like it though.
Must admit technically'

Nina: 'Well it used to smoke.'

Clarence: 'Well yes technically speaking I suppose it is burnt but well done I [UNK]'

Nina: 'Well it doesn't taste very nice.'

Clarence: 'I can't agree cos I, that's how I like it.'

Nina: 'And the s Well you used to scrape some of it off because it was all over the [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Oh if it gets really charred I know but'

Clarence: 'if it's really charred that's a bit'

Clarence: 'Certain degree of grey blackness even but'

Nina: 'And how d'you get toast charred so that you've got to scrape it off but it isn't burnt?
Oh I'

Clarence: 'Well leaving it that little bit too long, you know.'

Clarence: 'Remember Ro Robin coming home [UNK] I don't believe it, burnt burnt toast from an electric toaster.
I don't know how he does it.'

Nina: 'I don't know.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Oh well.
Doesn't feel like Sunday [UNK] does it?'

Nina: 'No.
I've not seen any more sight of that heron.'

Clarence: 'No.'

Nina: 'I don't, I think it was just a flash in the pan.'

Clarence: 'I don't think, well.'

Nina: 'I don't think I'm certain there's not'

Clarence: 'I think it's much to do about nothing quite honestly.'

Nina: 'I do.'

Clarence: 'I mean it may well be that we have to resort to some sort of er'

Nina: 'Well I don't feel like having a plastic heron.'

Clarence: 'Well I mean how do all the rest of the pond they've not all got bloody herons, plastic herons perched on the side have they?'

Nina: 'No.'

Clarence: 'Plastic [UNK]'

Nina: 'But you know d'you remember me going round the corner and seeing that erm'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: '[UNK] pond with all those plastic ducks on?'

Clarence: 'Flipping ducks on it.
Yeah I know.'

Nina: 'That might have been some deterrent of some description.'

Clarence: 'I don't think so somehow.
That was just [UNK]'

Nina: 'but I'm n I'm certainly not having little plastic ducks'

Clarence: 'Art nouveau.'

Nina: 'and little gnomes about.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
That's interesting er that erm comment Steve made about the postcard.
And the bird of prey silhouette, you know?
I can'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'believe that being rather effective.'

Nina: 'Well actually I have read about the heron that er I think was it I'm not sure that [UNK]'

Clarence: 'What the plastic plastic heron [UNK]?'

Nina: 'Oh [UNK] yes.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'No way.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
But that silhouette business, that could work you know.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'I can see that working.
Birds of prey.'

Nina: 'Well really when you think, it's only the same way as er laying the hose amongst your flower beds.
For cats.'

Clarence: 'Oh the snake you mean?
Yeah.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Mm I've still to have that proved to me to be honest.
It's a damn great snake'

Nina: 'Well I have.'

Clarence: 'isn't it?
If you think about it.'

Nina: 'Yes.
Well I think well, you know when we used to leave ours across the, the lawn there?'

Clarence: 'Mm, yeah.'

Nina: 'Well S'

Clarence: 'Cat didn't bother.'

Nina: 'Samba no he'

Clarence: 'No.'

Nina: 'Well he did a he did for a bit.'

Clarence: 'Are you sure?'

Nina: '[UNK] Yes, I've watched him sort of er warily'

Clarence: 'Waiting'

Nina: 'walk round.
But then he got so used to it that he didn't bother.'

Clarence: 'Mm, yeah.
That's what I mean.
It may, if it's any effect at all it's very short lived I think.'

Nina: 'Mm.
I don't think pepper's a very useful deterrent.
I've sprinkled loads of'

Clarence: 'No.'

Nina: 'pepper round.'

Clarence: 'One shower of rain and you've lost it anyway.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'I'd have thought.
Mm.'

Nina: 'I think the only deterrent is putting netting or something over it but er'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'you can't put netting over your whole garden can you?
It's silly.'

Clarence: 'No no.
We'll have to watch that pond though [UNK] leaves next year.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Well this year of course.
[UNK] Mm.'

Nina: 'Well I can't really see what you can do, only have netting over that when the leaves start to fall.'

Clarence: 'Well yes I could be a little bit more erm atten attentive to the damn thing couldn't I?
We need to sca scrape quite a lot of that out but erm not all by any means.
See a certain percentage have blown in I think off the grass and if I had some sort of a'

Nina: 'I was just er yeah.
I was just gonna say that.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'I think our problem here is it gets so windy with being on the corner.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'D'you want any more tea?'

Clarence: 'Oh yes please.
But I think mm mm.'

Nina: 'That was a silly question wasn't it?'

Clarence: 'It was unnecessary wasn't it? [UNK] oh yes I'll want a bit of a hand then.
With the top window'

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'I've left it with two screws holding it at the moment.
As we did, [UNK] painting the outside yeah.'

Nina: 'Yes.
I it won't blow out though?'

Clarence: 'No not at all.
I'm gonna hold it while you take the two final screws out.'

Nina: 'Oh I see. [UNK]?'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Cos it's almost impossible to get at it.'

Nina: 'It won't erm I think'

Clarence: 'What?'

Nina: 'once you've got the window done it won't be too bad will it?'

Clarence: 'You mean the whole frame?'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'And the opening light?'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'It won't be too bad, will it?'

Nina: 'Oh I mean, what I mean is you've not'

Clarence: 'Well there's not a tremendous amount of burning left.
There's only one skirting board and the pipe cover.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'The casing round the other cupboard.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'And that's it I think.
And possibly the edges of the cupboard doors, I don't know.'

Nina: 'Yes, they're not very brilliant.'

Clarence: 'No.
Mm certainly want cleaning up.
I may end up taking them off completely though.
I think that may be easier to do rather than do them in situ, you know? [UNK]'

Nina: 'Are you going to have a piece of cake?'

Clarence: 'Oh yeah.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'He's done this in two and then sandwiched them together.'

Clarence: 'What two cakes and put them together, he's?'

Nina: 'Yes.
Well I used to do that.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'It's quite good though.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
I'm trying to remember, did they have any, the kids?'

Nina: 'Erm'

Clarence: 'I know they cut some for them but'

Nina: 'It's a wonder Caroline didn't.'

Clarence: 'No.'

Nina: 'She usually stuffs doesn't she?'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Well yes. [UNK]'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Did Jill say what time Caroline's appointment was?'

Clarence: 'No.
Er well not to me she didn't.'

Nina: 'No well.
She pro she might have done to me but I can't remember.'

Clarence: 'In the afternoon.
They seem very confident they'll be back in time don't they?'

Nina: 'Twenty five to four to meet young'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Pick him up at twenty five to four.'

Nina: 'There's a heck of a lot of burning off when you come to think of all the burning off of paint we're going to have to do.'

Clarence: 'Oh god I know.
You're telling me.'

Nina: 'But then'

Clarence: 'Where possible I'll sand down obviously but there's there'

Nina: 'Yes but usually'

Clarence: 'won't be many places I'd have thought.'

Nina: 'There isn't.
It's'

Clarence: 'No.'

Nina: 'Cos it's been piled on so'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
I can't get over that screw in the woodwork.'

Nina: 'I know!'

Clarence: 'Good god.
I've seen dust before but and bits of fluff and rag and stuff but I've never seen a bloody, and a nail damn great screw!'

Nina: 'Well it's the same as the, the way they've papered the walls round.
They've just papered over things.
You know?'

Clarence: 'They've papered over, I know.
I know.
Mm.'

Nina: 'It wouldn't have been, if they'd had any furniture in when we, when we first got in I wouldn't have been surprised to see it painted round there as well.'

Clarence: 'Oh the [UNK] you mean?
Oh aye.'

Nina: '[UNK] mm.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.
No, coming back to the [UNK].
I would prefer to keep it in natural wood if we can but'

Nina: 'Oh yeah.'

Clarence: 'all those splodges of white are putty.'

Nina: 'Are they?'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Unfortunately.'

Nina: 'And there's nothing at all you can cover them with?'

Clarence: 'Well except to take them out.
Scrape the bits of putty out [UNK] and put some filler in that will accept stain.'

Nina: 'I think that'd be better.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
But that's a fairly long job though.'

Nina: 'Er yes, but I mean it it it would be worth it.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
See it won't accept stain anyway with that varnish on.'

Nina: 'Well I don't like this colour stain anyway.'

Clarence: 'Well I don't.'

Nina: 'It's a nasty colour.'

Clarence: 'You can't burn that off though.
It's dust.'

Nina: 'You couldn't'

Clarence: 'What?'

Nina: 'just give a dab of paint over?
A dark paint.'

Clarence: 'It'd stand out a mile wouldn't it?'

Nina: 'Would it?'

Clarence: 'Well perhaps not as obviously'

Nina: 'Well if you did it with a small brush?'

Clarence: 'Well it would still stand out wouldn't it cos it's a different colour?
Mm.
Not as'

Nina: 'You don't'

Clarence: 'not as obvious perhaps as the white but'

Nina: 'That's what I mean.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.
But I'll have to get rid of all that varnish before it'll take any other stain.'

Nina: 'Mm.
See what it's like.'

Clarence: 'I what it's like when?'

Nina: 'When you've got rid of the varnish.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
I may have to use varnish stripper.
Get a kind of varnish stripper for it.'

Nina: 'Well it might be better than erm doing it any other way because'

Clarence: 'I don't think it'll burn off.'

Nina: 'No I'm thinking of the fumes.'

Clarence: 'After all the other fumes I don't think that'll matter.'

Nina: 'After what?'

Clarence: 'After the fumes of the paintwork, I don't think that'll'

Nina: 'Won't that be worse than [UNK]?'

Clarence: 'No.
Not as bad as.
No no.'

Nina: 'Oh.
Cos I remember when you did twenty seven.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Ah well that was a varnish paint.'

Nina: 'That was quite'

Clarence: 'That was a varnish paint.'

Nina: 'And that won't, that'll just be [UNK] stain?'

Clarence: 'Varnish.
No.
It is a stain varnish.
[UNK] In other words varnish, with a stain added to the varnish before you apply it.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'As opposed to staining the wood and then varnishing it with'

Nina: 'Oh I see.'

Clarence: 'relatively clear varnish.'

Nina: 'Mm.
Once we've got those tiles off at the bottom there'

Clarence: 'Mm?'

Nina: 'well we might as well paint [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Well I think, I mean they're very nice, it would rather, I'd prefer to, it would be nice to have tile there to break it [UNK], but not those damn things and they certainly won't come off and go back.'

Nina: 'They're a bit messy aren't they?'

Clarence: 'Mm.
One two three four five six seven eight, twenty four.
Two dozen.
Mm.'

Nina: 'How many did we get in the pack?'

Clarence: 'The pack.
I don't know [UNK].'

Nina: 'I think it was twenty five.'

Clarence: 'I really don't know.
Oh it varies, the pack doesn't it?'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Think it is twenty five actually.
[UNK] pack anyway [UNK].'

Nina: 'But erm finding the right tile [UNK].'

Clarence: 'Yeah.'

Nina: 'In any case you don't want them all the same do you?
I think we're better off just snapping it off.
Wonder what state the wall's in?'

Clarence: 'Doesn't really matter all that much.
I'd skim over the plaster anyway.'

Nina: 'Mm.
Be a right mess won't it?'

Clarence: 'Mm.
It's highly probable I'll finish up skimming anyway.'

Nina: 'Mm I was just thinking that.'

Clarence: '[UNK] mm.'

Nina: 'I mean the way, what have they done here?'

Clarence: 'Well what have they done anywhere?
Mm.'

Nina: 'Well they ran short of tiles or they ha they wouldn't be bothered cutting.
I bet'

Clarence: 'That's more likely the case.
Mm.'

Nina: 'One two three four [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Twenty four.'

Nina: 'five six seven eight'

Clarence: 'Twenty four on this front face wasn't there?'

Nina: 'Yes, there was three more there.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'So that ma er in any case they'd of got some of it being the two colours.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.'

Nina: 'It looks quite effective [UNK].'

Clarence: 'Oh it's quite effective if it's done correctly, yes.
As it is now it's bloody awful.'

Nina: 'Have you had some cake?'

Clarence: 'Er no I'll give it a miss right now thankyou.
I'm a bit full [UNK] from my sandwich.
No I I'll enjoy it more'

Clarence: 'later on.
No no.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Cup of tea would go down like a bomb but'

Nina: '[UNK] you've not eaten it.'

Clarence: 'Possibly yes.
Mm.
Mhm.
I meant to ask, oh'

Clarence: '[UNK] Aha aha.'

Clarence: 'Pardon?'

Clarence: 'Right.
[UNK] Right. [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Pardon?'

Clarence: 'Er oh yes, yes I have actually.'

Nina: 'Let's put this cake back in its tin.'

Clarence: 'I'll have a cup of tea then bash on with my window then I think.'

Nina: 'Well the sooner it's finished [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Well, yes because it is at least dry today.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'But erm It's gonna make a hell of a racket sanding down afterwards you know.'

Nina: 'Well it can't be helped.'

Clarence: 'No it can't be helped, no.
I'll probably have to get some medium grade paper too.
Cos I've got a lot of gr fine and coarse but'

Nina: '[UNK] with us making a row won't they?'

Clarence: 'I can't think that all that much goes through you know, to be honest.
Obviously'

Nina: 'Yeah well but by and large we've not'

Clarence: 'Yeah.'

Nina: 'really been on their wall have we?'

Clarence: 'No that's what I mean.'

Nina: 'When we start down here [UNK].'

Clarence: 'Some of the heavier banging and the, the high pitch high frequency erm noises like me drill and erm'

Nina: 'Just keep it down to erm'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'a minimum [UNK] keep'

Clarence: 'Yeah yeah.'

Nina: 'not do it late, just keep stopping before it gets too late.'

Clarence: 'Well exactly what we have been doing.'

Nina: 'Cos it is annoying isn't it, you know?'

Clarence: 'Oh yeah.'

Nina: 'But there's not an awful lot you can do is there?
I mean if we had a firm of workmen in they'd [UNK]'

Clarence: 'They'd still do, yeah.'

Nina: 'they'd make more noise wouldn't they?'

Clarence: 'Oh rather more noise, yeah.'

Nina: 'But erm'

Clarence: 'And the clatter of tea cups.'

Clarence: 'But then I was meant to mention, ask Rachel if she'd seen the photograph cos Mike didn't know about the two photographs that er Rachel and Louise have taken.'

Nina: 'Mm.
Have I given yours, has yours got sugar in?'

Clarence: 'I don't know.'

Clarence: 'I really don't know.'

Nina: 'I'm not sure whether that has ha I can usually tell er I've'

Clarence: 'Well you claim to be able to.'

Nina: 'No I think it's, I can normally, yeah.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Mm.
I'm glad I found out what that is.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
What the hell's it called, a what?'

Nina: 'Erm'

Clarence: 'Something anemone wasn't it?'

Nina: 'Anemone blander'

Clarence: 'Oh yes?'

Nina: 'February to April.
Requires f the first to flower is A blander.
February to April.
Requires full sun as flowers close in shady conditions.'

Clarence: 'Mm will it get it there?'

Nina: 'Grow it in the rockery or naturali naturalize it in grassland.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'That sounds like it.'

Clarence: 'Well it looks like the illustration doesn't it?'

Nina: 'Well it looks li yes.
It does.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Mm can go by the leaves, I thought the leaves look like it too.
Well we look like getting, if it spreads'

Clarence: 'Has it yeah'

Nina: 'as much as it has there we look like getting [UNK].'

Clarence: 'Has it got the same number of petals on it?'

Nina: 'Yes, it similar, yes.
It's di, that's di, they differ.'

Clarence: 'Oh yeah.
Not just the colour and the number of'

Nina: '[UNK] Well I'm not sure but I'm not going out to count them.'

Clarence: 'Well it's [UNK].
I would have thought.
Must get some rose fertiliser you know too because erm I don't suppose the original plants have been fed for generations, literally.'

Nina: 'Oh you mean for those ramblers?
Yeah.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Well those ramblers and all over the place, mm.'

Nina: 'Mm.
It looks to me as if it's going to blooming rain again.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.'

Nina: 'I'm fed up with this weather.'

Clarence: 'Well it's a good general purpose fertiliser [UNK] isn't it?'

Nina: 'Yes.
What was the other one?'

Clarence: 'Growmore'

Nina: 'Growmore.
No.
Erm'

Clarence: '[UNK] You're the gardening expert.'

Nina: 'No I think it was the rose fertiliser, they said use it for the tomatoes as well.'

Clarence: 'Yeah that's right, yeah.
Ah!
That was right erm it was the tomato fertiliser wasn't it, that was quite good for something?
As well, er you know as well as the rose fertiliser.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Yes, they can use rose fertiliser for tomatoes.
But also tomato fertiliser apparently is useful for I don't know.
Look it up at the end of the book.
Incidentally what's this er operation that Jenny was on about?
Er not Jenny, Josie was on about this morning that er Jenny had?'

Nina: 'Caesarian.'

Clarence: 'Oh she had a caesarian did she?
I was forgetting she had a caesarian.'

Nina: 'Yes course she has.
That's probably why it's'

Clarence: 'Of course.'

Nina: 'taken her to get on her feet [UNK].'

Clarence: 'Of course, good god yes.
I was thinking it was [UNK] knit one purl one on the stitches you know, but mm.
Of course, oh yeah.
Oh yes.
Yes it was on the radio this morning about that erm it is in England somewhere I think a woman's given birth to a fifteen pound some ounces kid.'

Nina: 'Oh dear me.'

Clarence: 'Good gracious.
Tremendous size that is isn't it?'

Nina: 'Mm.
Yeah.'

Clarence: 'Mind its weight, I don't know about the size but mm.
We seem to have a tremendous lot of seagulls don't we?
Over that playing field there.'

Nina: 'Well it's being so windy isn't it? [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Yeah well I, no I'm generalizing throughout the year.'

Nina: 'Well we're not that far from the sea are we?'

Clarence: 'Of course not, that's true.
Yeah.
Mm.
Oh yes but I mean they they seem to concentrate pretty well round these playing fields for some reason.
[UNK] blackbird there.'

Nina: 'Yeah I know.
[UNK] the way they land.'

Clarence: 'Yeah it's interesting to watch the different birds, the different methods of landing.
Some are quite accurate.
The others are a bit sprawling those blackbirds I think.'

Nina: 'Mm the [UNK].'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
caw caw caw That looks like an old one to me doesn't it?'

Nina: 'An old fella'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Well not an old fella necessarily.'

Nina: 'I'm still sort of puzzling what the best thing, best thing to do for that hedge down there.
Cos we can't er until we get it cleared all the way along it although, it seems to change.
If you look'

Clarence: 'Hang on.
What seems to change?'

Nina: 'The hedge.
If you look from here'

Clarence: 'In what way does it ch [UNK]?'

Nina: 'Well if you look from here'

Clarence: 'I'm looking from here.'

Nina: 'And then you go along.'

Clarence: 'I'm going along.'

Nina: 'By the time it gets to that all that rubbish that we're going to shift.'

Clarence: 'Er y oh yes, there in front.'

Nina: 'Well then if you look it tends to change to a different variety [UNK] trees.'

Clarence: 'Oh it does there.
See what you mean.
Yes.
Yeah [UNK]'

Nina: 'I don't'

Clarence: 'it definitely does change doesn't it?
Mm.'

Nina: 'I don't know what they are, but one of those trees has little catkins on it.
Very poor.'

Clarence: 'Yes.'

Nina: 'So it obviously'

Clarence: 'I'm not surprised they're poor [UNK].'

Nina: 'I know I know.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'But erm it wants the roots clearing'

Clarence: 'Yeah.'

Nina: 'and feeding and'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.
Mhm.'

Nina: 'It's a shame though to let them die because th they're I like to have a, a different I don't want it all the same.
It's [UNK] boring isn't it?'

Clarence: 'Oh you're getting back to the privet hedge and suburbia aren't you? [UNK]'

Nina: 'That gives interest, especially'

Clarence: 'Same'

Nina: 'into the corner.'

Clarence: 'Mm that's why I don't want to clip that erm bottom hedge too cleanly.'

Nina: 'No but I think'

Clarence: 'Lop it down.
Yes I agree.
Lop it down but erm'

Nina: 'I think we need to, for th this time round because it'll soon get, you know'

Clarence: 'Take its own [UNK]'

Nina: '[UNK].'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.
Yes maybe you're right.'

Nina: 'But I do think for now we're just going to have to cu chop it down.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'It's going to get worse and worse if we don't.'

Clarence: 'Have to keep our eyes open for a decent er path cutter, hedge cutter you know?'

Nina: 'Yes.
I looked in the paper to see if there was any.'

Clarence: 'No there weren't.'

Nina: 'They're very expensive to buy aren't they?'

Clarence: 'Oh new they are certainly yes.'

Nina: 'Yes, and you want a double action one?'

Clarence: 'Preferably.
Not essentially.'

Nina: 'I, I wouldn't think that erm like the different length of the blades.
You don't want a very big one.'

Clarence: 'I don't think you need the, think it's a twenty four is it? [UNK] no.'

Nina: 'I would think they're more trouble than they're worth unless you've got'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
They could be.'

Nina: 'a great big [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Oh and you'd have to be that little bit more careful too.'

Nina: 'Mm.
Yes exactly.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: '[UNK].
I think that's what [UNK]'

Clarence: 'And again, unless the motor is fairly hefty [UNK]'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'it could conceivably be easy to burn the motor out.
Because it's doing more work isn't it?'

Nina: 'I don't [UNK].'

Clarence: 'Mm well in theory.
A bigger area, bigger length.
You're cutting more at the same time.'

Nina: 'Yeah I was looking at the petrol driven ones. [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Good god.'

Nina: 'I know.
That's what I thought.'

Clarence: 'Stone the crows.
Cor.'

Nina: 'It took me breath away so'

Clarence: 'Good gracious me.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'No no.'

Nina: 'Just how'

Clarence: 'What?'

Nina: 'much erm how much can you cut with those as opposed to having needing the erm, the other ones that are used for trees.
Erm'

Clarence: 'Chainsaw?'

Nina: 'chainsaw.
I couldn't, forget the word.
The chainsaw.'

Clarence: 'Oh they'll take er do a fair amount of work but erm I think, certainly as far as the hedge is concerned'

Nina: 'Well I know that.'

Clarence: 'Yeah hang on.
Hang on.
In a well established hedge like that'

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'I would think er the loppers, if the erm hedgecutter won't tackle it the loppers will'

Nina: 'Yes but what I was thinking more'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'is the rest of the, round there round at the side there.
I mean a lot of the you know when we start getting rid of all the rubbish down that side?'

Clarence: 'Er I wouldn't like to put er erm a hedgecutter through that erm that bush there.
That's a little bit too heavy for it.'

Nina: 'Which bush?'

Clarence: 'Well the one where the hedge terminates and'

Nina: 'Mm well.'

Clarence: 'That dead looking e well dead [UNK]'

Nina: 'No.
No but would it do to, I mean you're going to have a lot of the stuff that we chopped off'

Clarence: 'Yeah.'

Nina: 'to put to, if we're getting a trailer and getting rid of it all.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'You're going to have to cut it down still further into smaller pieces aren't you, to get as much as you can in the trailer?'

Clarence: 'Oh I see what you mean, to cram on the trailer.
Yes.
Yes yes.'

Nina: 'Will a hedgecutter do there or will you have to u revert to erm a chainsaw?'

Clarence: 'Er combination of both I should think.
I, well I'm not too concerned about that anyway.
I can use the loppers.
If we were doing it seven days a week, fair enough, you'd probably need a chainsaw but [UNK] anything, the loppers or the handsaw.'

Nina: 'Oh handsaw?
Oh that's hard work.'

Clarence: 'No.
No no no no not the really not the thick ones [UNK]'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'But erm'

Nina: 'Well I was just thinking of taking the work out of it.'

Nina: 'Mm it's one hell of a lot of work [UNK]'

Clarence: 'But you see we don't really need a chainsaw do we?'

Nina: 'No I wouldn't say so normal but er there's quite a lot to [UNK]'

Clarence: 'No.
No.
No.
To hire one possibly for a specific [UNK] specific job but'

Nina: 'I wonder how much they are to hire?'

Clarence: 'Not very dear.'

Nina: 'Oh aren't they?'

Clarence: 'What erm chainsaws?'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'I think last time I looked at the hire list, price, price list'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'I think about five six quid a day something like that, they were last year.
Mm.'

Nina: 'Oh that's not bad really.'

Clarence: 'Oh it isn't bad if you've got a lot of erm chainsaw work to do.
That can be done in a day you know.'

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Now whether that's erm including all the protective clothing or not I dunno.'

Nina: 'I don't know.'

Clarence: 'There might be a different charge for that but'

Nina: 'Er did you think any more about the er rubbish clearance that was, they were advertising in the paper?
I mean what d'you think?'

Clarence: 'Oh the twelve quid's worth wasn't it?
Was it twelve?
Sixteen.'

Nina: 'Sixteen quid for one load.
What's a load?'

Clarence: 'What is, well yes.
Anything that'll fill a skip, it'll be a skip.'

Nina: 'Skip [UNK].'

Clarence: 'And I suspect that'll be the smallest skip, I don't know.'

Nina: 'I would imagine so.'

Clarence: 'Did it say from?
What did it just say?'

Nina: 'No I think it just said sixteen pounds a load and I'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'thought mm I wonder how much a load is.'

Clarence: 'Well yes, it's probably the smallest skip.'

Nina: 'But it'd save a lot of hard work if you got rid of quite a lot of it.'

Clarence: 'See I don't see erm them shifting very much for that because by the time you've got a bloke out paid his wages, paid for the the erm skip shifter, transporter you know.'

Nina: 'Well if this is a skip.
It might just be a trailer.'

Clarence: 'It might be a trailer.
It might be an open back lorry, you know.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'A lorry?'

Clarence: 'Yeah.'

Nina: 'Well we could get rid of qu I doubt it whether they're going to shift that'

Clarence: 'Well, you know mm.'

Nina: 'I doubt that.'

Clarence: 'But again on a costing basis I mean hourly.
How long is it gonna take a chap to load loads?'

Nina: 'Yes but I'm thinking I mean there's so much to do here Larry, you er you know, you're not a young man any more.
You can't er do too much.'

Clarence: 'Er I had noticed.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.'

Nina: 'It's no good wearing yourself out if you can get anything done'

Clarence: 'I was worn out already.
What are you on about?'

Nina: 'You know what I mean.'

Clarence: 'I'm knackered.
Mm.'

Nina: 'But it makes sense to me to have a little bit of help.'

Clarence: 'Oh I'm not adverse to having bit of help'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'you know of the right sort.
No no no, no no no, no [UNK] Erm'

Nina: 'You're usually pretty independent.'

Clarence: 'A little perhaps but er I mean you can have people that are more damn trouble than they're worth can't you?
Quite honestly.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Spend your time watching'

Nina: 'Well you know the, all the stuff that you've got at the side where'

Clarence: 'Ah well that's straight on the trailer, yeah.'

Nina: 'Is it?'

Clarence: 'Well more, more or less, yeah.
One or two things I'll be keeping but most of it it's just straight, that's why it's all piled up ready to go.'

Nina: 'Ah but I wasn't just meaning on the concrete bit.
I was meaning on the soil.
There's loads and loads of what you trimmed off the [UNK].'

Clarence: 'Oh that's not rubbish that's just erm off the trees isn't it?'

Nina: 'Well it's still got to be got rid of hasn't it?'

Clarence: 'Chuck it over the fence and it'll go straight in, more or less straight in the trailer won't it? [UNK]'

Nina: 'It'll be just like you to get your trailer and your car down there when er [UNK] arrive and [UNK].'

Clarence: 'Oh highly probable.
Sod's law, yes [UNK].'

Nina: 'I know.
I can't get over the fact that, that all'

Clarence: 'What?'

Nina: 'all through the winter we've had daisies all over the grass.'

Clarence: 'Oh yes you mean the fact that they've been in flower [UNK]?
Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'You don't usually see daisies do you [UNK]?'

Clarence: 'I honestly don't know Nina.
I don't know.'

Nina: 'Mm don't think it's dry enough to cut the grass is it?'

Clarence: 'Oh I w, no I wouldn't do it today.
No, crikey no.'

Nina: 'No I don't think so.
It doesn't look very promising.'

Clarence: 'No.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'It makes it hard work doesn't it? [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Oh yes.'

Nina: 'Have to do a bit at a time.'

Clarence: 'I'm going to investigate, see if I can't do a conv I don't think for one minute I will but it's possible do a conversion er into erm the box type.
Cos that way all the or most of the cuttings at least, go into the box wouldn't they?
It's possible.'

Nina: 'Oh it might be more trouble than it's worth.'

Clarence: 'It might be.
It might sound a bit potty but utilizing that small vacuum cleaner and cutting the erm'

Nina: 'Ah don't use'

Clarence: 'No?'

Nina: 'No I, I prefer using it just as it is quite frankly. [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Well i it's not a big thing, it's only you know what I mean don't you?
That yellow and green one?'

Nina: 'Yes I know what you mean but I don't fancy you messing about with the grasscutter.'

Clarence: 'No'

Nina: 'Cos I find it if there's anything else attached to it'

Clarence: 'It depends which mounting.
Keep the centre of gravity low and there'd be no problems.'

Nina: 'No I don't, I can't agree with you there.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Maybe not, no.'

Nina: 'No, leave well alone.'

Clarence: 'Mm'

Nina: '[UNK] don't you?
And then you just make a mess of what you've already got.'

Clarence: 'It's quite possible but erm'

Nina: 'Mm but I, I mean I can use it as it is now but anything else on to it I would find it difficult.'

Clarence: 'Well I'm gonna bash on with the erm'

Nina: 'Right, are you ready for the window yet?'

Clarence: 'Well er yes please.
We can do it now then.'

Nina: 'Well I'll come and do that then [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Okay.
Right.
And hopefully by teatime I should have got the burning done.
Right, away we go.'

It's a shame isn't it?'

Clarence: 'Mm and they shouldn't be can't, rather it can't be down to lack of contact I wouldn't have thought.'

Nina: 'No.'

Clarence: 'In part I suppose it's due to erm complete contrast of lifestyle between Jill and Steve's way and our way.
Could be.
[UNK] She was just like an automated programmed doll, oh god.
Poor kids can't help it of course but [UNK]'

Nina: 'No she's such a nice little thing [UNK]'

She may change quite a lot, on the surface anyway.'

Nina: 'Oh she has done already hasn't she?
She's better than she was.'

Clarence: 'Oh indeed yes.
Yes.
Certainly has.
Mm.
I mean it's most unnatural for a child not to be chatting away in the presence of grandparents isn't it?
Unless the grandparents are a couple of weirdies.
Perhaps she thinks we're two weird, no I'm weird anyway.
Could be right.'

Clarence: 'Could be right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's not a bad evening now is it?'

Nina: 'No.
Have you seen a weather forecast for [UNK]?'

Clarence: 'No.
[UNK] very brief [UNK] this morning I think.

And then I think more rain tonight [UNK].
But as the girl in the post office said erm it's usually different here than the weather forecast which is probably is, the gulf stream'

Clarence: 'It's not too bad finding where you want to go'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'when it comes to looking for x-ray or path lab or whatever it is but finding your way out.
Very seldom they have continuing er continuity of markers saying exit, you know, or this way out.'

Nina: 'Wouldn't it, it's stupid that'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'isn't it?
You can't get out quick enough can you, usually?'

Clarence: 'Not short on the emergency exit signs, but yeah exactly.
Mm.
I mean [UNK] once you've got in.
But once you've gone down and turned left then turned right and gone ahead [UNK]'

Nina: 'I, I know Carolyn said that they in the end'

Clarence: 'Yeah.'

Nina: 'they refused to work on their own'

Clarence: 'Oh that's right I remember.

Mm.
And di didn't she have to leave [UNK]?'

They're not too bad here but at Witham Withamshaw it'd be a different kettle of fish altogether.'

Nina: 'Er yes.'

Clarence: 'Mm.

Nina: 'Mm because do you remember when we had to go and collect her?
That night.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.

Clarence: 'Were we really?
Mm.'

Nina: '[UNK] she was in the flat.'

Nina: 'And she'd passed out in the phone box.'

Clarence: 'Oh yes, that's right.
Mm.'

Nina: 'Wasn't he?'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'And Nicky wanted to, it was only a cock's stride down the road.
Andrew was in bed and she just whipped out so Nicky could say goodnight to her daddy.'

Clarence: 'Oh yes, that's right.
Mm.'

Nina: 'Oh dear.
What a performance.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Yes, you get so used to having a phone at home don't you?'

Nina: 'Mm.
It's very handy.
Having to go to the end of the road, well it's daft now.
That's if you can find one working.'

Clarence: 'Not too bad here from what I've seen.'

Nina: 'No.'

Clarence: 'No.'

Nina: 'No but I mean in Manchester it was shocking wasn't it?'

Clarence: 'Oh well!
It was a very pleasant surprise if there is one working.
Mm.'

Nina: 'You know I was just thinking'

Clarence: 'Were you?
Jolly good.'

Nina: 'That well Lil and Nev going up on the mini break'

Clarence: 'W tomorrow is it they go?'

Nina: 'Yeah Wednesday to Saturday, yes.'

Clarence: 'Mm go on.'

Nina: 'I'll bet they hear of these mini breaks through the wh I can't remember'

Clarence: 'She probably'

Nina: 'her name.'

Clarence: 'Was it Carol?
No it's not Carol.'

Nina: 'No.
No it's'

Clarence: 'I don't know what her name is but I know the one you mean.
The travel agency girl?'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Young woman, yeah.'

Nina: 'I wouldn't be surprised.'

Clarence: 'Probably.
Mm.
Mm.
I'm wondering what made them change their mind over the er knock through into the garage.'

Nina: 'Well I suppose they thought it was a bit too much.
I mean the place they've got there, it er [UNK] it would mean'

Clarence: 'Oh I'm not sugge'

Nina: 'that them decorating'

Clarence: 'I know.'

Nina: 'the whole lot again wouldn't it?'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Oh no way.'

Clarence: 'Yes but surely they thought that through before they got to the stage that I mean even with the mortgage'

Nina: 'Well that's probably why they've decided against it.'

Clarence: 'No.
Before they got to the stage of asking for quotes because Nev had moved all his tools and tackle and stuff to clear it.'

Nina: 'Had they actu actu really had a quote?'

Clarence: 'I don't know.
I really don't know.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'They were due to get one.
Any time.'

Nina: 'They might have had one and found out what it was going to cost and were decided against.'

Clarence: 'Possibly.'

Nina: 'They're having a mini break instead.'

Clarence: 'Oh possibly again i it's just possible actually that the construction of the bungalow didn't lend itself properly well to knocking through.'

Nina: 'Well I think oh well it's so beautiful I mean as it is in there, they don't need anything doing to, I mean'

Clarence: 'Well'

Nina: 'they've got it nice.
They've got it so they don't get s sort of minimum you know?'

Clarence: 'Labour.'

Nina: 'Yes.
So I shouldn't imagine that erm I mean once we've got through this one I'm blowed if I'm going to do it'

Nina: 'just for the sake of doing it.
It'll have to really need it before we start again.'

Clarence: 'Well mm.
Oh yeah I know.
But they, they are a little bit inclined to what shall we spend some money on next, aren't they?'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Well if it's there fair do.'

Clarence: 'Oh!
Fair do, I know but er it's up to them what they do with their money I know but mm.'

Nina: 'What's happened to the rest of the paper Larry?
There's only half of it there.'

Clarence: 'Well which paper [UNK]?'

Nina: 'The Telegraph.
Last week's Telegraph.
There's only one'

Clarence: 'I haven't the faintest idea.'

Nina: 'sheet there.
Just one'

Clarence: 'One sheet?'

Nina: 'Well one section.'

Clarence: 'Oh.
I don't know.
I haven't the faintest idea.'

Nina: 'It's just disappeared.'

Clarence: 'I haven't moved it at all.
Not knowingly anyway.
No.
It's possible I've used it but I don't erm don't recall.
Never had an occasion to use, well the only time I've used a newspaper as far as I know this afternoon when I emptied the bag.
And that was'

Nina: 'Because we were going to phone up'

Clarence: 'Yeah I know.'

Nina: 'the piece at with the'

Clarence: 'Yes.'

Nina: 'housing in.'

Clarence: 'Yes for the er'

Nina: 'We were going to phone up and that seems to have'

Clarence: 'the two bungalows yeah.
Mm.
It is incidentally [UNK].
It's where I thought it was.'

Nina: 'Is it?'

Clarence: 'On the left hand side [UNK] and erm it's pretty near the main road.'

Nina: 'Mm.
Oh I know where you mean.'

Clarence: 'Oh you do?'

Nina: 'I think I do anyway.'

Clarence: 'The area [UNK].'

Nina: 'Mm.
I thought it was on the main road?'

Clarence: 'It is on the main road.'

Nina: 'Oh I see what you mean, the front's pretty near the main road?
Would that bother them do you think, being so close to the main'

Clarence: 'I don't know Nina.
I haven't the faintest idea.'

Nina: 'Cos it looks quite a decent reasonable bungalow.
I wonder how much they want for it?'

Clarence: 'I d I could only glanced at it as I drove past cos the traffic was moving fairly quickly for the lights there you know.
But'

Nina: 'Mm.
I bet the layout's something similar to that one we saw further [UNK].'

Clarence: 'Probably.
There's not much of a difference between'

Nina: 'No, it looks the same shape somehow doesn't it?'

Clarence: 'No.
Mm, yeah yeah.
[UNK] fairly tight.'

Nina: 'But that, they're, the one that'

Clarence: 'Sorry, go on.'

Nina: 'we went to er look at, four of them, in the middle of er the three.'

Clarence: 'Oh yeah.
Where Whereabouts was that?'

Nina: 'There was four four it was in the middle.
The girl that works at the garage, sh next door to that.'

Clarence: 'Oh not a bungalow, a house you mean?
Sorry, yeah.'

Nina: 'A house.
Well that one, I mean everybody said oh that's too near to the main road so if that was too near to the main road so will this one be.'

Clarence: 'Well did Carolyn say that?
I can't remember.'

Nina: 'No Dawn said.
Neither can I.'

Clarence: 'Well Dawn thought it was.
I certainly thought it was.
But then'

Nina: 'I know.
I didn't.'

Clarence: 'I don't like traffic noise.'

Nina: 'It w yes it, I'd, it wouldn't have bothered me that.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'But it, I can quite see that it would bother some people.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'But it's not as if it's a main road like'

Clarence: 'Oh crikey, no.'

Nina: 'in Manchester is it?'

Clarence: 'Oh no.
No.'

Nina: 'There you could complain but I, I wouldn't say you get that much traffic at night.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.
Certainly not at night you won't get a lot, no.
Erm'

Nina: 'Well you wouldn't notice during the day.
You don't notice the same.
It's when everywhere's quiet.
And you're trying to sleep.'

Clarence: 'Yes but it's noises you don't notice, if they're continuous then they become'

Nina: 'That's right.
True.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Mm.'

Nina: 'Still'

Clarence: 'I mean that's one of the beauties here wasn't it?
It's so peaceful, so quiet.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'There's no noises to get used to really.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Apart from the birds and the bees and the'

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'sycamore trees.'

Nina: 'And Sambo [UNK].'

Clarence: 'And Sambo flying around yeah.
No he just crawled under the door sort of glare, [UNK] glare at me and then scootled, shooted past, you know.'

Nina: 'Why?'

Clarence: 'Shot I should say.'

Nina: 'Shooted past.'

Clarence: 'Shooted past.
He shooted past as well as shot past.
Mm.'

Nina: 'I wonder why?'

Clarence: 'I don't know because he he's never really been frightfully keen on me, that cat.'

Nina: 'Maybe it's probably has a rough working idea it's you that put the fountain on today.'

Clarence: 'I doubt that very much indeed.
Get on.
No.
No.
No I try [UNK] to him but you know but er'

Nina: 'He's lovely.'

Clarence: 'He's alright.
He let me sort of tickle him and god knows what but er he's pretty wary for some reason.
It may well be of course that father [UNK] was a bit er all dog and no cat sort of person, you know?
I dunno.'

Nina: 'Mm.
The they're both, they're all in lovely condition aren't they?
Beautifully cared for.'

Clarence: 'Oh yes.
No argument about that, yes.
Good nick'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'and well fed and'

Nina: 'Yes.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Mm.
Now we've decided not to do that little built up wall affair at the front'

Clarence: 'Hang on.
Oh there, yes.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'it erm we won't need to be bothered quite so much about getting paving stones.
Or stones, suitable stones to build will we?'

Clarence: 'Well we won't be needing so many that's for sure, no.
I want some for the erection at the side of the pool there.'

Nina: 'What?
Oh there.'

Clarence: 'To take the waterfall.
Mm.
It's only gotta match the existing er'

Nina: 'Well how many do you want?
I mean don't you want to put it on bricks?'

Clarence: 'Not bricks as such, no.'

Nina: '[UNK] just'

Clarence: 'Cut some of the paving stones'

Nina: 'I see.'

Clarence: 'to roughly brick size'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'and use that.
As I have done with that erm'

Nina: 'Well how many will you need?'

Clarence: 'collection Pardon?'

Nina: 'You won't need that many for there.'

Clarence: 'Not no no no no no.
Not an awful lot, no.
I can pad out with sto with er brick where it doesn't show.
It'd look a bit odd with bricks though, I think.'

Nina: 'Mm.
True.'

Clarence: 'Oh yeah.
And then we want matching slabs really don't we?'

Nina: 'Yes.
That'd be nice actu to have erm something you could sit on there.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Wonder what do they do with old gravestones when they've er'

Nina: 'Ooh I hate to think.'

Clarence: 'when they've abandoned the graveyard.'

Nina: 'Well they seem to be there for er you know when they did all that erm levelling at erm Southam Southam cemetery?'

Clarence: 'Yeah.'

Nina: 'I wonder what they did with them then?
They just flattened it didn't they and and [UNK].
It's a bit much when you come'

Clarence: 'Yes, they made it so it could be'

Nina: 'to think of somebody paying a fortune for a'

Clarence: 'Yes.'

Nina: 'gravestone and then they come along and flatten it.'

Clarence: 'Oh there must have been some sort of arrangement, I don't know.
To, to cope with that though.'

Nina: 'Well quite a few of them [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Well bear in mind a lot of them were very old ones and there are'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'probably no nearest and dearest left surviving.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'True.'

Clarence: 'I seem to remember [UNK] papers about that.
Erm that removal or disposal or alteration of the any creation around the grave was erm can be done at the discretion of, of the'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'parks authority or whatever it is, yeah.'

Nina: 'It was better really when they'd done it'

Clarence: 'Parks and cemeteries, yeah.'

Nina: 'wasn't it?
It was much neater.'

Clarence: 'Oh yes.
Both in far more pleasant to the eye'

Nina: 'Oh yes.'

Clarence: 'far neater and er oh yeah.
They can get more bodies in too [UNK].'

Nina: 'Ooh!'

Nina: 'Shall we change the subject?'

Clarence: 'No I ha!
[UNK] No I just had a thought because there must be stacks of old grave gravestones around.
Some of the marble they cracking [UNK] cracking bit of, yeah I know.'

Nina: 'No they yes they are.'

Clarence: 'Should be for the price they charge too.
Ridiculous [UNK] forking out a fortune.'

Nina: 'I wonder how many I wonder how many people have now got them as hearths?
Now this marble er this kind of marble hearths.'

Clarence: 'Yes you've got, yeah.
Yeah that's a point.
That's a point.'

Nina: 'I don't like that thing we've got there. [UNK]'

Clarence: 'I think they're rather thicker than that, the damaged gravestone.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
When you think of all the [UNK].
Go on.'

Nina: 'Mind you it it's indestructible really isn't it?'

Clarence: 'Oh'

Nina: 'Once you've got it down.'

Clarence: 'I wouldn't say indestructible, but I know what you mean, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah very very longlasting, yeah.
Depends on the quality of the marble too doesn't it?'

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'Obviously.
No I was gonna say, when you think of all the money that's spent with these very elaborate er headstones erm creations showing angels looking down on them, plonking at their harps and god knows what.
They look quite nice from one point of view [UNK] but er fifty seventy eighty hundred years later what the hell does it matter?
You know?'

Nina: 'Mhm well I suppose it does to some people.
We've got to decide what to do at our fireplace yet haven't we?
Ooh what a problem.'

Clarence: 'Well if we get some headstones it'll be different.'

Nina: 'If you know if you, pardon?
If you take'

Clarence: 'Cor.'

Nina: 'the top off, the wooden part'

Clarence: 'Er yes.
The mantelpiece?'

Nina: 'Yes.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.'

Nina: 'Do you think it'll it's sort of cut so that the er it fits on top of the brickwork?'

Clarence: 'That one is I'm pretty sure, yes.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'Do you think it'll look still look cock-eyed, the brickwork?'

Clarence: 'Yes.'

Nina: 'Mm.
Mind you it won't matter if we erm [UNK] will it?'

Clarence: 'Oh no that will [UNK].'

Nina: 'Fancy building, I mean that must have been done when, when the house was built.'

Clarence: 'No.
No no, it's not original that.
No.'

Nina: '[UNK] the original one then?'

Clarence: 'You can see where the original fire surround was.'

Nina: 'Oh.'

Clarence: 'Look at the plaster work there behind it, above it.
Mm.
And where's the hearth different hearth isn't it?'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Yes, that's right.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'I'll be glad when that's done.
It's going to be a big job really.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
No I should imagine it's a typical sixties, late sixties erm well early sixties er tile surround, you know?'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'It's not'

Nina: 'When you look there's, there's really there's only this room'

Clarence: 'Go on.'

Nina: 'to remove the paper.'

Clarence: 'Erm'

Nina: 'Er the the the two rooms, like the big room and the bathroom'

Clarence: 'And our bedroom.'

Nina: 'Oh there's not much to move in'

Clarence: 'There's in there, no.'

Nina: 'in the be because I think'

Clarence: 'Not, no.'

Nina: 'the paper that's in the wardrobe alcoves?'

Clarence: 'Yes.'

Nina: 'Well if that's firm it'll erm be washing over there won't it?'

Clarence: 'Lick over.
Oh yes.
Yes it's good enough there.'

Nina: 'Well there's only the little bit on the breast of the er the chimney breast type of thing'

Clarence: 'There's between the two yeah yeah.'

Nina: 'that needs removing.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'And that was, that came off quite easily on the other wall.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
[UNK]. Mm.'

Nina: 'There's not that much to do so this is the main one really.
And the bathroom [UNK].
Mm.'

Clarence: 'For wallpaper removal?
Oh yes.
I need to see how those steamers work, how well they work.'

Nina: 'Well, they must work fairly well because erm'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'well Joan and Clive were saying they did them.'

Clarence: 'Yes and Derek remember, next door?'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'And Terry [UNK], he said [UNK].
He hadn't used one before, and he was a bit cackhanded.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'So they must have been pretty good.'

Nina: 'Mm. [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Nice just to'

Nina: 'Carolyn was saying that a friend of theirs down the road she hired one'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'and finish she didn't know where to stop.
And she it was so quick.
Yes it was very efficient.'

Clarence: 'You mean it was working so quick and easy?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'And erm she was very impressed.'

Clarence: 'Oh.
Do you remember the old days when it was standard practice to put one paper on top of another?'

Nina: 'Ooh!
How many pa'

Clarence: 'With the overlap.'

Nina: 'I know.
How many papers did we move'

Clarence: 'You know?'

Nina: 'off the er'

Clarence: 'Oh god I don't know.'

Nina: 'the old [UNK].
Oh about seven.
Oh dear.'

Clarence: 'Yes.
Yes it probably was.
Yeah.
Mm.'

Nina: 'What a job.
It was a heck of a long way up there as well wasn't it?'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
But do you remember the borders?
The edges I should say at the, at the roll?'

Nina: 'Mm.
Yes.
I do.'

Clarence: 'They used to have little marks to line the paper up when you hang it.'

Nina: 'Oh?'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Down the'

Nina: 'Can't remember that.'

Clarence: 'Exactly.
Down the edge'

Nina: 'Mm?'

Clarence: 'the name of the manufacturer and possibly the say the model like the that particular paper's erm category name.
But it had at about oh eighteen inch intervals, something like that?
Little marks, sometimes an arrow sticking out.
When you, when you put the next roll on you married up the arrow.'

Nina: 'Oh.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Mm.'

Nina: 'I remember cutting out when you used to have to cut all down your rolls of wallpaper.'

Clarence: 'That's right.'

Nina: 'And do you remember when you had to cut all your borders out?'

Clarence: 'Yeah but don't you remember when they had that erm erm semi-perforated edge on it?
And you knocked it on the edge of a table?'

Nina: 'Oh yes.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Things have changed a bit.'

Clarence: 'Yes.
I don't quite know why they put that edge on in the first place.'

Nina: 'No.'

Clarence: 'Unless it was, in those days, they didn't have the shrink wrap stuff did they?'

Nina: 'I think they used to overlap them one edge didn't they?'

Clarence: 'Oh didn't th I was just thinking yeah.'

Nina: 'That's right.'

Clarence: 'Oh it was standard to, yeah a standard practice job that, yeah.'

Nina: 'To overlap.
Well you could always see the join.'

Clarence: 'Oh yes of course.'

Nina: 'And the joins they've put on this wallpaper here they stand out'

Clarence: 'Oh god.'

Nina: 'about a mile don't they?'

Clarence: 'Well this particular paper, you you've got to be very care'

Nina: 'I don't like it.'

Clarence: 'otherwise it crushes very easily.'

Nina: 'Mm.
I don't like it.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
No.
It's not my favourite [UNK] by any means.'

Nina: 'We'll have to go and be having a look at at erm'

Clarence: 'What?'

Nina: 'choose a paper for the room where we're doing now.'

Clarence: 'Yes, there's a bit more plastering to be done yet.'

Nina: 'Not a lot though is there?'

Clarence: 'Not a lot, no.
I want to skim that corner, ceiling and the top of the wall.
Erm'

Nina: 'And strip all the little [UNK]'

Clarence: 'and [UNK] there's also there's a usual crack between the plasterboard and ceiling over the door and a little crack running down to the door.'

Nina: 'Is there?'

Clarence: '[UNK] yeah.
It's worth doing.'

Nina: 'Oh yes.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'And do it properly.
Well [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Oh yes.
And there's all the burning off and mm.
And also I want to, while the carpet's up, investigate the run of the cable.
So it's'

Nina: 'And have you any idea yet?'

Clarence: 'About?'

Nina: 'Where the cable runs?'

Clarence: 'Yes.
Yeah, yeah.
I think it's a spur coming off that runs into the er But I don't think it's a proper imme immersion heater circuit.'

Nina: 'You're joking?'

Clarence: 'Well it doesn't have to be.'

Nina: 'Should it be?
Oh.'

Clarence: 'No it doesn't have to be.
No no no.
No.
No.'

Nina: 'There's a a mark on the wall, you know where the switch is where you switch the pump on and off?'

Clarence: 'Er yes.'

Nina: 'Well there's a mark on the wall.
Something's been on the wall that was round.'

Clarence: 'Yes.
That would be erm the junction box.
Mm.'

Nina: 'Why would they need another junction box there then?
Cos there's one down at the bottom.'

Clarence: 'To feed I s would suspect the immersion heater.
Mm.'

Nina: 'Oh.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Well what have they taken it off for then?
Oh they wouldn't need, they wouldn't mm.'

Clarence: 'Because y you, when you have your cable up to the junction, hang on up to your junction box'

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'and from the junction box to the actual immersion heater itself'

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'you have erm a heatproof cable called er systaflex I think it's called.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Er it's sort of a white, braided stuff that goes over.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Heat resistant.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'So you'd need a junction box to erm connect the'

Nina: 'Well you know how they've you know where the pipe comes out of the cupboard?'

Clarence: 'Hang on.
There are a lot of pipes.'

Nina: 'No, the the pipe that I w I think supposedly leads to the radiator.'

Clarence: 'Erm'

Nina: 'And it comes down under that little'

Clarence: 'do you mean the one with the pump in?'

Nina: 'Yes.'

Clarence: 'Oh that pipe.
Yeah, yeah.'

Nina: 'By the wall, and it'

Clarence: 'Oh.'

Nina: 'comes into that little erm ooh the sort of semi skirting board thing.'

Clarence: 'Erm'

Nina: 'That stands away from the wall.'

Clarence: 'offhand I can't say yes I do but'

Nina: 'Well it it's flat and then it comes down.
You've got your skirting board'

Clarence: 'Flat and then it comes down.'

Nina: 'It houses pipes.
And it's'

Clarence: 'Oh you you mean in the room?'

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'Yes but I mean which pipe you mean, no.'

Nina: 'Well I don't know the pipe.
I haven't seen the pipe have I?'

Clarence: 'Oh it's in the oh sorry, go on.
Carry on.'

Nina: 'No.
This thing but er er the pipe comes from the cupboard.
You can see it'

Clarence: 'If there's a pipe or pipes [UNK] cupboard yeah.'

Nina: 'I dunno but it you can see it coming through'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'and it into that housing'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'and then it comes right round to the radiator'

Clarence: 'Yes I know, yeah.'

Nina: 'and goes right to that wall doesn't it?'

Clarence: 'Yes.
Yeah yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'Well why would it need if that, if it does that, when it gets to the radiator'

Clarence: 'Oh it's not just for the radiator.'

Nina: 'Oh.
I see [UNK]'

Clarence: 'It's the hot water to the tap in the kitchen.'

Nina: 'Oh I see.'

Clarence: 'That's right, yeah.'

Nina: 'As well.
Well what I was looking at this afternoon was your radiator comes through the floor.
And yet all these pipes are here.
Why isn't why wouldn't they take erm your radiator pipe the water, the pipe that feeds the radiator?'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'Why wouldn't it come through that little housing?
Instead of coming under the floor?'

Clarence: 'Well again that's not original is it?
The central heating system is er a later addition to the house isn't it?'

Nina: 'Oh.'

Clarence: 'And those pipes were where the circs where the, the where the pipe run to the hot water tap in the kitchen.
And to the bathroom.'

Nina: 'Oh.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
And quite probably the cold water supply to the bathroom too.
Mm.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'And I think not the kitchen, that's on the rising main.
Cos your stop tap is underneath the er'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'sink top there.
[UNK]. But that one there is er fed, I'm pretty sure from the, yes it is.
Yeah because the pipe goes up there.
Mm.'

Nina: 'Oh yes of course.
It goes right through to the bathroom doesn't it?
That's it.'

Clarence: 'And, if you think about it, there's a header tank in the loft.'

Nina: 'Yes.'

Clarence: '[UNK] the cold water from somewhere.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'So it'll come from there across the ceiling'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'across the ceiling up through the erm cupboard'

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'into the l into the loft and [UNK].'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
So [UNK] you'll have the hot water pipe to supply the hot tap'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'taps.
And the cold water feeds by the er header tank in the loft.'

Nina: 'Mm.
Well why wouldn't they take them underneath the floor?
They could of, couldn't they, up there?'

Clarence: 'Yes they certainly could.
But at the time of building I think it was just continued practice from the victorian days to run it round on the top.
Mm.
Pretty sure.
There has been, or appears to have been, a hole in the wall that's been plastered up rather badly but above that housing, that cover'

Nina: 'Mm?'

Clarence: 'on the bathroom wall'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'the wall separating the bathroom from the spare room'

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'from the back bedroom in the bottom there's been a hole about the size of a pipe'

Nina: 'Was there?'

Clarence: 'about three quarter pipe, yeah.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Or fifteen mil twenty two millimetres yeah.
Mm.'

Nina: 'I think I'll wash up and then have a cup of tea.'

Clarence: 'What a good'

Nina: 'What time is it?'

Clarence: 'time we had a wash up and a cup of tea I think.
It's two and a half minutes to six o'clock.
Or eighteen hundred.
Oh the news.
Let's see if the queen's dead.'

Nina: 'Pardon?'

Clarence: 'Where's the new oh is that the news?'

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'See if the queen's dead.'

## 026507

Well [UNK]'

Nina: 'The only thing I [UNK] only I don't know all the names of some of the people.'

Clarence: 'Oh I wouldn't know any of them.'

Nina: 'But apart from that it's not a very difficult one.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Let's have a look what's what.'

Clarence: 'Is it based on the contents of of rather the erm'

Nina: 'Yes.
It is.'

Clarence: 'people on the box?'

Nina: 'It is.'

Clarence: 'Oh crikey, I w definitely wouldn't know.'

Nina: 'Pardon?'

Clarence: 'I definitely wouldn't know, no. [UNK]'

Nina: 'Oh you would.'

Clarence: 'up my nose it's erm quite erm'

Nina: 'I know.
I went in there and I thought something was burning.
Don't let me forget there's a cake in the oven will you?'

Clarence: 'Not a bun but a cake.
Right. [UNK]'

Nina: 'You know what I'm like.
I forgot it completely last week.'

Clarence: 'Well what time do I remind you?'

Nina: 'Remind me at half past half past if I don't remember myself.'

Clarence: 'Half past six?'

Nina: 'Yes.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Well it's quarter past six now.'

Nina: 'I know what it is now but'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'I'm quite capable of forgetting in about five minutes.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Well it wouldn't take me that long [UNK].'

Nina: 'Oh dear.'

Clarence: 'Quite a bit more [UNK] today anyway.'

Nina: 'Oh well yes.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'It's a hard slog isn't it?
I wish we'd got a bit further really but it's hard work.'

Clarence: 'There's a lot of work.
But we, we're getting there slowly.
Mm.'

Nina: 'Let's have a look and see what's what.'

Clarence: '[UNK] you see the doors are different, quarter inch difference in size.'

Nina: 'You wouldn't, I wouldn't have thought that.
[UNK] the same.'

Clarence: 'No it didn't surprise me cos they usually no, they put the casing up, the door casing.'

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'And then the chippie erm cuts the door to fit.
[UNK] it, you know?
Very seldom you get it a perfect fit when you'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'just [UNK] it in.
Fortunately it is the right way round.'

Nina: 'Mm.
I don't think they, I would have thought that everything was more or less'

Clarence: 'Well it is more or less.'

Nina: 'spot on'

Clarence: 'No.
No.'

Nina: 'size.
When the houses were built at the same time and'

Clarence: 'They possibly are today.
Erm a lot of stuff's factory er'

Nina: 'Is that the sort of job that er Ken would be doing?'

Clarence: 'On the building site, yeah.'

Nina: 'Oh.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'Mm.
Did you hear Josie was saying about er'

Clarence: 'What?'

Nina: '[UNK]?
He's busy on this building project now but he doesn't know after.'

Clarence: 'Oh she said a few days ago about [UNK] some bungalow or something he's he's helping to build.
He, he's a brickie isn't he?
Yes that's right.'

Nina: 'Yes.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'Whereabouts?'

Clarence: 'I haven't the faintest idea.'

Nina: 'Oh.'

Clarence: 'Not the faintest.'

Nina: 'So it they, he'll be worried if oh mind you er anything in the building trade is a bit iffy isn't it?
I can't see Ken'

Clarence: '[UNK] yeah.'

Nina: 'getting a a job really, can you?
Certainly not now. [UNK]'

Clarence: 'I'd have thought he's going to find it extremely difficult down here to find a job.'

Nina: 'Because I don't [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Of any sort.
Never mind just in the building trade.'

Nina: 'Yes, I don't think he'll rush down [UNK].
But he's so used to being [UNK].'

Clarence: 'Well he's got all his mates [UNK].
And he er I don't think he's got the confidence to [UNK].'

Nina: 'No.
I don't.'

Clarence: 'No.'

Nina: 'And then again he's getting older, I mean [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'it's more difficult as you get older [UNK].'

Clarence: 'See I did see there's that place erm erm oh it's going, it's Tearscross direction.
Erm'

Nina: 'Erm'

Clarence: 'they advert'

Nina: '[UNK]?'

Clarence: 'Well, they advertise in the paper every week.
Advertise [UNK] carpenters and joiners.
But [UNK]'

Nina: 'The thing is er where he is now'

Clarence: 'Mhm.'

Nina: 'er when, mind you he's been in his job for a while now.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'But I mean when the jobs have finished he's always'

Clarence: 'Well he'

Nina: 'managed to get on to another one pretty well straight away.'

Clarence: 'See hang on no no no.
The job's been never finished never will be finished with the corporation on it.
It's amazing [UNK].
Specially there.'

Nina: 'No but I mean, I don't mean wh I don't mean where he's been working for the corporation, I mean before when he's had these various jobs and they've finished and he's had, you know, the job's finished and they've had to go somewhere.'

Clarence: 'Oh the shopfitting and mm mm mm.
Mhm.
Mhm.'

Nina: 'He's always been quick at picking another job up [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Oh to be fair to him, yes he has.
He's been very quick at that.'

Nina: 'But as you get older that's not so easy is it?'

Clarence: 'No, precisely.
No.
No.'

Nina: 'And he might not find it so easy here.
Cos there's so many more people in pretty much the same trade.'

Clarence: 'I would have thought so.
Yes.
I would have thought so.'

Nina: 'Mm.
And it just isn't commonsense to commute'

Clarence: 'No.'

Nina: 'to Manchester is it?'

Clarence: 'Oh he'd never do it.
It's ridiculous.'

Nina: 'Mind you, the only thing that I was thinking of, do you know when he was commuting'

Clarence: 'Ah.'

Nina: 'that firm he was working for'

Clarence: 'Yeah, can't'

Nina: 'to Sw was it Swansea?'

Clarence: 'It probably was Swansea area.
I think it was, yeah.'

Nina: 'Yes it was Swansea area.'

Clarence: 'Go on.'

Nina: 'He seemed to like that, although he did get fed up with it [UNK].'

Clarence: 'Ah yes but it was quite a different run you see Nina.
That was motorway nearly all the way.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'And he could do it in less time.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'It was a straight run.
There was no driving involved.
You just point the car in the right direction press the [UNK] pedal and you're there [UNK]. [UNK]'

Nina: 'It was still a long way.'

Clarence: 'It's a longish way but erm for Ken it's not quite the same as erm the A roads and B roads and'

Nina: 'No.'

Clarence: 'oh no.'

Nina: 'No.'

Clarence: 'Cos he doesn't really like driving.'

Nina: 'No he doesn't.'

Clarence: 'No.'

Nina: 'And it is a bit of a tedious journey.'

Clarence: 'He'd never do Mike's job.
Well he'd never do Mike's job anyway but'

Nina: 'Oh no.'

Clarence: 'you know, the driving side [UNK].'

Nina: 'No but Mike enjoys it doesn't he?'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'He covers a a rattling big area.'

Clarence: 'He's got a big area to cover, Mike if you think about it. [UNK]'

Nina: 'He seems to enjoy the job doesn't he?'

Clarence: 'Seems to yes.
Mark you he wouldn't crack on if he didn't.
No he wouldn't say very much about [UNK].'

Nina: 'Well no I don't suppose so.'

Clarence: 'No.
No.'

Nina: 'But goi reading between the lines, you can usually have a a rough working idea [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Oh yes he obviously likes it better than when he was at er at that erm what do they call themselves? [UNK]'

Nina: 'Oh I can't remember now.
Erm oh well you see'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Oh a hi fi firm.'

Nina: 'he doesn't l like being tied to the bench does he?'

Clarence: 'Oh no.
He'd sooner be out.'

Nina: 'And I think I think he does his job well anyway.'

Clarence: 'I'm quite sure he does his job extremely well, yeah.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'So all is well.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'It, it's a sha I feel sorry for young married couples these days.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'It's very hard going isn't it?'

Clarence: 'Oh yes.
Mm.
Oh yes.
Well'

Clarence: 'Go on.'

Nina: 'Mm.
I was gonna say something, I've forgotten.'

Nina: 'As is my wont.'

Clarence: 'Well you usually mm.'

Nina: 'Mm but I can't see, I don't think Carolyn would have much difficulty.'

Clarence: 'Er no I d particularly in view of her experience'

Nina: 'Cos yeah'

Clarence: 'I don't think she would.'

Nina: 'Exactly.'

Clarence: 'Quite as much anyway.'

Nina: 'No I don't.'

Clarence: 'She might have to wait a wee while but I think she'll get on, yes.'

Nina: 'I think so.'

Clarence: 'And possibilities for Carolyn'

Nina: 'Yes.'

Clarence: 'came now.
I don't we may be completely wrong.
But as far as this exchange business is concerned.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'You'd never get erm you'd never get an exchange.'

Nina: 'No.'

Clarence: 'I don't think we operate that scheme now.'

Nina: 'Larry have you got any books out from the library?'

Clarence: 'No.'

Nina: 'That needs taking back?'

Clarence: 'No, no.'

Nina: 'I was just looking at that, going right off the subject but er that Uri Geller?
I bet that's interesting?'

Clarence: 'It's er moderately interesting so far, yes.'

Nina: 'Yes.
I wouldn't mind reading that.'

Clarence: 'No I thought you might.
That's one, another reason I got it out from the library.
Erm it rabbits on quite a lot up to now.'

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'About all the er astonishment, amazement the English press and public and the Swedish press and the public and the American press and public, you know?
Push push push all the time.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Erm'

Clarence: 'Yes well of course you can only assume that what he says is correct.
He's quoting various er authorities on the subject [UNK].
I've only just started the damn thing really.'

Nina: 'How did he er y how did he first find out that he w he had this [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Well he that's why he wanders on a bit.
Erm keeps giving little bits erm It was when he was a child apparently, he claims to have been aware of it, you know?
Mm.'

Nina: 'A ch as a child?'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'How young?

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Let's have a look.

Clarence: 'You certainly shoot through the first few ch chapters of that anyway.'

Nina: 'Yes.'

Clarence: 'Oh yes.

In effect.'

Nina: 'What's an ongoing topic? [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Politics.'

Nina: 'In five.'

Clarence: 'Is this based on TV then or?'

Nina: 'Well you pretty much, yeah.'

Clarence: 'Oh well [UNK].'

Nina: 'Yeah er no I don't think that is.'

Clarence: 'Mm?

Clarence: 'I can't think of any TV quizzes or panel games or'

Nina: 'Well that er that's not. [UNK]'

Clarence: 'You don't think it is?'

Nina: 'I don't think so, no.'

Clarence: 'And you haven't got any of the letters?'

Nina: 'I don't suppose Al you know Albert Square's yuppie [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Probably.
Where else could we go?'

Nina: 'Erm well we do'

Clarence: 'Other than that er rather expensive'

Nina: 'Well what I, I do like about St Ishmal's is the way it's laid out and [UNK]'

Clarence: 'It's laid out but the plants look healthy and they're kept in healthy conditions.'

Nina: 'They do.
Yeah.'

Clarence: 'Mhm.
To me that Dingle place'

Nina: 'I wasn't very struck on that.'

Clarence: 'I wasn't at all struck, no.'

Nina: 'No I wasn't.'

Clarence: 'There were all weeds growing among the plants they're selling.'

Nina: 'Messy.'

Clarence: 'Yes, messy.
And it wasn't just the messiness, I don't mind that, but'

Nina: 'No. [UNK]'

Clarence: 'They weren't looked after.'

Nina: 'cos you it was difficult to find the things that you w you want oh I don't know, it was just'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'it didn't erm didn't appeal to me somehow.'

Clarence: 'No.'

Nina: 'But erm I remember when we got the original broom that we've got in the garden now, the golden one'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Where did we get that?'

Nina: 'We got that at St Ishmal's.'

Clarence: 'Did we?
[UNK] Mm.'

Nina: 'And erm they're sort of labelled, you know what, it gives you this picture of what you're buying as well.'

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'It might be a bit of a job erm keeping them separate.
[UNK] growing into one another.'

Nina: 'But I don't think so.'

Clarence: 'No?'

Nina: 'Oh no.'

Clarence: 'Oh.'

Nina: 'Well, it doesn't really matter.'

Clarence: 'Oh that's alright then.
Good.'

Nina: 'Because I mean they don't sort of grow out, they grow up don't they?'

Clarence: 'I've no idea. [UNK]'

Clarence: '[UNK] Saturday or Sunday?'

Nina: 'Saturday.
You know where I've put you know down the bottom end of the garden, th that little bit of digging?
To shape the ga er where the grass is?
Right up in front of the sweetpeas?'

Clarence: 'Erm the left or the right?'

Nina: 'Right down at the bottom there by the apple tree.'

Clarence: 'Do you mean where the daffs are going? [UNK]'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Fuchsia?'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Because we've got some nice ones.
And then those that Karen brought us, they were nice.'

Clarence: 'Yes.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'Got some lovely ones.'

Clarence: 'Mhm.'

Nina: 'Well I thought they'd be protected by the fence.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Mm.'

Nina: 'Wouldn't have much room for sweetpeas though would I?
I don't know though, they'd grow up behind wouldn't they?'

Clarence: 'Yes.
Course they will, yeah.
Mm.'

Nina: 'The only problem being cutting the hedge.'

Clarence: '[UNK] Pardon?'

Nina: 'The only problem being cutting the hedge.'

Clarence: 'Cutting the hedge?'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Oh yeah.'

Nina: 'But'

Clarence: 'But how often do you have to cut that sort of hedge then?'

Nina: 'Not a lot.'

Nina: 'And we didn't know what it was. [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Er all I can remember [UNK] a lot of plants coming.'

Nina: 'Yes well'

Nina: 'I remember that in a little pot down there and you know they were labelled?
She put the labels on.'

Clarence: 'Oh yes she did, a label mhm.'

Nina: 'Well I'm sure I remember the anemone blander'

Clarence: 'Mm.
I don't know.

Nina: 'And I was reading about the conditions.
Maybe with erm erm putting fertiliser on them you know'

Clarence: 'Mhm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'erm [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Mhm.'

Nina: 'I think it [UNK] and it's come up [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Ah!'

Clarence: 'Well, good o.'

Nina: 'It looks quite pretty now but it could be quite [UNK].'

Clarence: 'Well [UNK].'

Nina: 'Yeah, true.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
I've come across a bit of architrave by the way.
Quite apart from'

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: '[UNK].
Erm [UNK].
So I can use that as an experimental piece.'

Nina: 'Where? [UNK]'

Clarence: '[UNK], there's stuff come to think of it it's the one in the hall.
The doorway that's bricked up.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'Oh of course.
I keep forgetting there was a doorway there when we arrived.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
That's right.
[UNK] the architrave from there.'

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'Erm it's exactly the same varnish stain as this.'

Nina: 'Is it?'

Clarence: 'So I can muck about on that piece before I tackle it in here, so mm.
[UNK] stripping goes.'

Nina: 'Oh I see what you mean.
To to er see'

Clarence: 'Without staining, without [UNK] what?'

Nina: 'Mm that's true.
To see if w what colour we can get that we like instead of this?'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'First of all what's the best stripping medium.
Whether it's gonna be gentle heat, whether it's gonna be varnish stripper?
Paint stripper?
What the hell.
And then see the go on.'

Nina: 'Er w do you have to strip it?'

Clarence: 'If we want to change the colour.
Unless we're going to use a varnish stain as such.
But it's very, and it looks a bit crummy, that stuff I always think.'

Nina: 'Ooh [UNK].
Ooh well I don't know, [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Mm.
See look at'

Nina: 'It's a big area.'

Clarence: 'Pardon?'

Nina: 'It's a big area to strip.
Why, wouldn't it'

Clarence: 'Well it's only what erm the architrave the arch there this side, that side and that one there.'

Nina: 'Well I mean if you had it sort of darker, wouldn't it stain darker slightly?'

Clarence: 'Well as I say you can't stain varnished wood Nina.'

Nina: 'Oh.'

Clarence: 'You can put a varnish stain on.
Varnish stain [UNK] but erm In in this particular light now I can see where they've put on thick blodges that run down.'

Nina: 'I know, it's terrible isn't it?'

Clarence: 'Mm. [UNK]'

Nina: 'I wouldn't think that was a professional job.'

Clarence: 'Oh what was?
I don't think [UNK].'

Nina: 'But well originally what would they have done with it?
When it was built?'

Clarence: 'Oh no I don't think, I don't think it's from square one.
It probably would be varnished from square one but that's not the original varnish.'

Nina: 'No.'

Clarence: 'Shouldn't think, no.'

Clarence: 'I doubt it very much indeed.'

Nina: 'shocking colour [UNK] isn't it?'

Clarence: 'Yes it is.
And do you know the old bog door, it's the same colour as next door's.
Or was I should say.'

Nina: 'Was it?'

Clarence: 'The same yucky blue, yeah [UNK].'

Nina: 'Was it?'

Clarence: 'Mm.
So if you look at the next time you're in the loo'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'where the handle was, look where the blue shows.
And that's that was the original colour.'

Nina: 'That w do you think that's what they did originally?'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
The original colour, yeah.'

Nina: 'Mm [UNK] when it was built?'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: '[UNK] blue didn't they?'

Nina: 'Do you remember that er flat that Lil and Nev er went into?'

Clarence: 'Oh goodness.'

Nina: 'Before they'

Clarence: 'Oh down here [UNK]?'

Nina: 'Everywhere you looked was blue.'

Nina: 'I find blue a depressing colour even though I like blue.
I mean I'

Clarence: 'Well it's [UNK] isn't it?
Blue for depression and red for excitement and'

Nina: 'Yes but'

Clarence: 'What's a calming colour? [UNK]'

Nina: 'For a decoration in a home I don't like blue.'

Clarence: 'No, no.'

Nina: 'And yet young Nicky's gone for blue.

That's true.'

Mm.'

Nina: 'Some of it looks nice, but I wouldn't like [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Well it'll die the death eventually won't it?

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Isn't it?'

Nina: 'Yes, well I think I think it's overdone.'

Clarence: 'Course it's overdone.'

Nina: 'I like a bit but'

Clarence: 'It's blooming cheap half of it.
It is cheap.
Er no it isn't cheap [UNK].'

Nina: '[UNK] cheap.'

Clarence: 'God no.'

Nina: 'I wouldn't say that.'

Clarence: 'Cheaper than [UNK]'

Nina: 'It's a bit glaring to me.
I find it so, it's not as mellow as I like.'

Clarence: 'No, it's not.
[UNK]. It's usually crummy wood.
Badly assembled.'

Nina: 'Well it depends how much you're going to pay for your furniture doesn't it really?'

Clarence: 'Well I mean the one that er [UNK] that er thing, what is it?'

Nina: 'I know.'

Clarence: 'Oh yeah.

Clarence: 'Mm.

Nina: 'No.

Nina: 'I think she was ill when'

Clarence: 'Was she short, dumpy podgy sort of thing and?'

Nina: 'Well no, I don't know.
I don't remember [UNK].'

I wonder if John and John and er mm'

Nina: 'Liz.'

Clarence: 'Liz have moved yet.'

Nina: 'Well we thought they had last time we went.
Do you remember?'

Clarence: 'Oh yes, I vaguely remember that but I, whether they'd actually moved or not I don't know.'

Nina: 'I wonder what had happened to the stool.'

Clarence: 'Which stool?'

Nina: 'Th do you remember er who was going to, oh I don't [UNK] it was the store that Robin made.'

Clarence: 'Oh the tall stool Robin made?
Yes yes.'

Nina: 'Yes.
And Rob and John and Liz were hanging on to it [UNK] somebody was going to pick it up weren't they?'

Clarence: '[UNK] actually.'

Nina: 'I've forgotten.'

It was a state of chaos then though wasn't it?'

Nina: 'Well I wouldn't like to move, we are not moving again [UNK].'

Clarence: 'Oh god no.'

Nina: 'No way.'

Clarence: 'Never again.
Well if we do we'll wait another sixty years anyway.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Oh what an upheaval.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'I don't know how people can move from one place to another.
Do the place up then'

Clarence: 'Well'

Nina: 'move over to another place.
Oh heck, no thank you.'

Clarence: 'it depends on a lot of factors really doesn't it?'

Nina: 'Mm'

Clarence: 'Or a lot of factors come into it.
Age group finances'

Clarence: 'desire to move for a variety of reasons, erm [UNK] permanently regarded [UNK] house in the first place, you know?'

Nina: 'Mm I mean like in Jill's case, Jill and Steve'

Clarence: 'Yes, that always struck me as a bit odd, yes.'

Nina: 'I it's a big upheaval every few years isn't it'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'to have to do it with your job?'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Mm.'

Nina: 'And it's worse when you've got children to cope with as well.'

Clarence: 'That and the obvious school problem too with the kids, yeah.'

Nina: 'Mm.
I don't think it's good for them moving them about from school to school do you?'

Clarence: 'No it can't be.
Well I don't know about that, I mean with some schools it'd be a good idea to get them away from it.'

Nina: 'Well'

Clarence: 'And some areas, in fact.
I mean [UNK] really desirable to move away from there wasn't it?'

Nina: 'Er well that's true.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
And privately it would be no bad thing to move away from where they are now.
I mean, well they're gonna have problems wherever they go, but the on erm a different estate different type of estate, they wouldn't have as many problems would they?'

Nina: 'Mm I don't know so much.'

Clarence: 'I don't think so.
Not as many.'

Nina: 'I've found out how to get rid of the cat scratching.'

Clarence: 'No another idea?
What is it this time?'

Nina: 'No, it's not my idea.
Apparently you can get'

Clarence: 'No, no?'

Nina: 'pellets of er lion dung'

Clarence: 'Oh I, yes.

Clarence: 'somebody on Gardener's Question Time answering that?'

Nina: 'I didn't know you could get it in pellets.'

Clarence: 'Well either did I but'

Clarence: 'For obvious reasons, yeah.'

Nina: 'Mm.

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Price per bag is eight pound oh it's eight [UNK] eight pound ninety nine'

Nina: 'I'm still looking for me broom [UNK].'

Clarence: 'Was it broom?'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'It's not worth looking on the box for the news because it's, they'll be nothing new.'

Nina: 'I can't find it.'

Clarence: 'Mm.

Clarence: 'There's no there's no price on there I presume?'

Nina: 'No that's just the thing.'

Clarence: 'Ooh!'

Nina: 'It's a stupid habit, not putting the price on.

Clarence: 'Well it's possibly at the request of the vendor you know.'

Nina: 'I know they do.
But what I'm saying is people'

Clarence: 'Oh yeah I know.'

Nina: 'a lot of people, if they're, alright if you want it, you're interested, and you're interested you'll find out.

Nina: 'Johnston'

Clarence: 'Oh, St Peter's Road one is it?'

Clarence: 'I don't know.'

Nina: '[UNK].
Unless it's a misprint.'

Clarence: 'Well misconstruction about the use of a room more likely but where's me other windows?
Can't see with these damn things.
Most attractive detached bungalow blah blah blah blah blah Come to think of it I don't think it is that one.
I don't think that's the one on St Peters.'

Nina: 'You don't?'

Clarence: 'No.'

Nina: 'It's a similar'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'shape and Did it have two chimneys?'

Clarence: 'Yeah.

Clarence: 'It's, it's not in this week then, that one?'

Nina: 'No it doesn't seem to be.
At least I, I didn't see it.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'I might of missed it.'

Clarence: 'Yeah that's possible.
Ouch!
This other one in Johnston will be fairly pricey I think.'

Nina: 'Erm I have the'

Clarence: 'This white one.'

Nina: 'feeling it could be.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Eighteen foot lounge job. [UNK]'

Nina: 'Well it's, isn't it lounge stroke dining room?'

Clarence: 'Mm.
It can't be much for sixteen.'

Nina: 'No you wouldn't think so.'

Clarence: 'Coo not today. [UNK]'

Buying without seeing?'

Clarence: 'Oh!

Nina: 'You can't fathom people would be so crazy.'

Clarence: 'I couldn't.
You just have to be a fool.
That people could buy a property unseen, well you know, it's ridiculous.
And the price [UNK]'

Nina: 'I wonder how many w It's a pig in a poke.'

Clarence: 'I mean just when you think about it they they were actually following estate agents when they went out to value a property.'

Nina: 'I know.'

Clarence: 'Gee, god.
But now I mean what a difference.
Mm.
I find it a bit hard to believe what [UNK] said about being the boom's coming ba not boom but picking up.

Nina: 'Er ooh'

Clarence: 'Hang on, hang on, hang on.

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'So it's less to walk.

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.'

[UNK]: 'But er when I'm gone it's too late. [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Oh indeed, yes, yes of course.'

[UNK]: 'But if er if they come back and they're tidy enough'

Clarence: 'No I don't think so.'

Nina: 'You've not left anything upstairs have you?'

Clarence: 'No no.
It smells like burning [UNK].
Mattresses or blankets, the carpets'

Nina: 'Well it's not here.
We've not got anything burning.'

Clarence: 'No.
I've not had a blow lamp going this morning at all.
It's probably come in with the door being open.
It may even be the school you know?'

Nina: 'Oh of course.'

Clarence: 'Burning some rubbish in the er'

Nina: 'It could be, yes.'

Clarence: 'in the incinerator thing they've got there.

Many different types of smoke and pong.
Wood smoke, when you're camping is'

Yeah yeah.'

Nina: 'Remember when we used to take the pressure cooker when we went out?'

Jolly good.'

Nina: 'Nice.'

Nina: 'I never use that now do I?'

Clarence: 'No.'

Nina: 'But I wouldn't get rid of it, because just in case.
It's erm'

Clarence: 'We went camping again?
Well that's not very likely!'

Nina: 'I don't think so'

Clarence: '[UNK] No thank you.'

Nina: 'No but you never know.'

Clarence: 'I do.
I'm not gonna go.'

Nina: 'I don't mean camping I mean'

Clarence: 'Oh I see.
Yes.'

Nina: 'You know?
It might come in handy.'

Clarence: 'No I know what you mean.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'I made jam in it. [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Yes I have a hazy recollection of that.'

Nina: 'It was quite nice really.
So that was'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'it cut the cooking time down.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'It was quite easy.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Seems an awful long time ago in some ways, you know, camping.'

Nina: 'Well it is!'

Clarence: 'Yet other ways it doesn't Nina.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'The erm difference in cer some things can seem a long time ago and some are relatively recent.'

Nina: 'Mm.
Yes I wonder what'

Clarence: 'It doesn't really seem all that long since our lads in shorts, you know?'

Nina: 'It doesn't.
[UNK]. For god's sake Larry.'

Clarence: 'And there they are thirty nine [UNK].
No no seriously'

Nina: 'Best look forward, not back.'

Clarence: 'Oh I know.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'It's a pity that this house'

Clarence: 'Oh.'

Nina: 'is erm'

Clarence: 'Which ones did you heave, by the way?'

Nina: 'Oh, only the ones I knew she wouldn't have.
Er economy seven.'

Clarence: 'Oh my god, yeah.'

Nina: 'Erm terrace'

Clarence: 'Well hang on, no.
You didn't put a definite no on economy seven did you?'

Nina: 'Well they were terraces.'

Clarence: 'Oh well fair enough.
No I'm talking about economy seven in case you heave'

Nina: 'Well I think that'

Clarence: 'any more [UNK]'

Nina: 'Yes she did.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'She wants gas cooking.'

Clarence: 'She prefers er far prefers gas cooking I know, but'

Nina: 'You, I think you'll find she won't even contemplate cooking by electricity.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'I doubt that very much.
What's this one?
This looks, they look like Barratts.
It's an end terrace.'

## 026611

Nina: 'This one.'

Clarence: 'Mhm.'

Nina: 'It looks very small.
It's an end terrace.
She wouldn't rule out an end terrace but'

Clarence: 'Ah is that the one the Barratt type place?'

Nina: 'Well I yes.'

Clarence: 'Yeah well'

Nina: 'Well that looks like a Barratt type as well doesn't it?'

Clarence: 'Yes.
Exactly, yes.
It's the same estate isn't it?'

Clarence: 'It is yeah.
The same address, same area.'

Nina: 'Yes, it is.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'But there's quite a difference in price if you notice.'

Nina: 'Forty two for this.'

Clarence: 'And thirty something for that.
Thirty seven I think it was, something like that.
Could be wrong.'

Nina: 'Yes it is but I think this is the one erm this is'

Clarence: 'This is this is, this is'

Nina: 'Erm wait a minute.'

Clarence: 'Mhm.
I don't like either, to be honest with you, but there we are.'

Nina: 'Oh I don't dislike them but it's not one that'

Clarence: 'Well if you weigh that other one up the end one.'

Nina: '[UNK].
This, which?
This one?'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
There wouldn't be room for the caravan to start with.'

Nina: 'I thought there would.'

Clarence: 'No I don't think so, no.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'I think you'd find there would.'

Clarence: 'No.
I don't think there would be.'

Nina: 'That's well it looks like it to me.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.
Full stop.
That'd be it.'

Nina: 'Just let's read what it says.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
No room for a garage.
No parking a car is there?
From what I can see of it.'

Nina: 'Mm.
[UNK] style entrance door which opens'

Clarence: 'Oh yeah.'

Nina: 'to the entrance hall.'

Clarence: 'It's erm important to remember by the way'

Nina: 'What?'

Clarence: 'Well some estates, not many of course, but some estates have got a no go area for caravans parked don't they?
Mm.
I don't think we're likely to meet it here to be honest with you but yes you do get it.'

Nina: 'Ah well there's a caravan parked round the corner.'

Clarence: 'Well I'm just saying I just said that we're not likely to get it here.'

Nina: 'No.'

Clarence: 'But erm it would be a damn sight safer down here wouldn't it?
It wouldn't get vandalized, broken into scratched, bashed or whatever.'

Nina: 'Grounds, here we are.'

Clarence: 'Tell me, the'

Nina: 'Lawn, just a mo.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Go on.'

Nina: 'Property stands within established principally lawned garden'

Clarence: 'Yeah I read it.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'shrubs, trees'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'Privacy from the roadway which is what she would like.'

Clarence: 'Depends what you mean by privacy of course, but go on.
Privacy or privacy as they seem to say these days, don't they, sometimes?'

Nina: 'Well I say privacy.
I don't know [UNK].'

Clarence: '[UNK] carry on saying it whether it's right or wrong.
Same with controversy and controversy.'

Nina: 'Controversy.'

Clarence: 'I know, I still [UNK].
It's a real controversy though.'

Nina: 'Yeah I [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Controversy.
God, you've got me at it.'

Clarence: 'You see?'

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'How easily you can change.
Good gracious me.'

Clarence: '[UNK] Did you notice this morning on the box, the er weather girl?'

Nina: 'No I didn't.'

Clarence: 'She uses controversy and er'

Nina: 'Did she?'

Clarence: 'Our friend what's his name, Mike is it?'

Nina: 'Yes [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Yes.
He did the accidental I'm sure, controversy.'

Nina: 'Oh.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
And she [UNK]'

Nina: 'It's it's easier to say for some reason or other and yet'

Clarence: 'Well it is for us because we've always been saying it.
But I don't see any reason why it should be easier.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Controversy, controversy.
It's just accent on the'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Fed up with plaster up me nose and'

Nina: 'I'm fed up with this stage altogether.'

Clarence: 'Oh strewth, yeah.'

Nina: 'I'll be glad when we get it cleaned and we can start the actual'

Clarence: 'There's quite a lot of it to do yet.'

Nina: 'decorating bit.'

Clarence: 'Well we're [UNK] it's it's the er first principles, prepare your surfaces isn't it?
Which we're doing.'

Nina: 'Oh I know that.'

Clarence: 'No.
But that's the mm.
Well we've finished the burning off in there.
Yeah so that's one pong gone.
Very largely gone.
It still lingers on a bit though.'

Nina: 'Oh yes.'

Clarence: 'There's not an awful lot more filling to do, but there is a bit of course.'

Nina: 'Erm not plaster there's no more plastering is there?'

Clarence: 'I sincerely hope not.
No there's no more plastering.
No.
No.
Just filling now.
Imperfections you know?
Joints and [UNK], stuff like that.
And that [UNK], it's a pity about that [UNK] but I'm leaving the damn thing [UNK]'

Nina: 'Oh, yes'

Clarence: 'Fancy putting boss white?'

Nina: 'You know what they say?
Never trouble trouble.'

Clarence: 'Oh I know.
If it works leave it alone, but'

Nina: 'I'll say.'

Clarence: 'erm on balance it's best left on and to just'

Nina: 'Well it is really'

Clarence: 'Yes.'

Nina: 'if we can get away with it.'

Clarence: 'Oh yes.
I'd far sooner take it off and do a proper job but well'

Nina: 'It er well it's easier isn't it, really?
But on the'

Clarence: 'Well'

Nina: 'other hand, you might have problems with it leaking if you take it off anyway, so'

Clarence: 'Well that's a p yes exactly, yes.
Cos [UNK]'

Nina: 'No, if you've got to'

Clarence: 'and I've got to scrape out all that horrible boss white.
Cos it goes rock hard that stuff, over the years you know?'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Boss white. [UNK]'

Nina: 'I wonder whether it was leaking in, when they put it in in the first place?'

Clarence: 'Do you mean that's why they used boss white?
Possibly.
Yeah.
Mm.'

Nina: 'Well let's not erm ask for trouble because there's more than enough to do without having [UNK].'

Clarence: 'Oh quite, yes.
Mm.
Have you noticed that by and large, not all the time of course but I should say that eighty percent of the time birds face that way?'

Nina: 'No I've never noticed which cos I'm'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Cos see that pigeon is now.'

Nina: 'Oh yeah.'

Clarence: 'In the tree, yeah.
[UNK] Mm.
By far the majority of the time.'

Nina: 'It looks like a picture doesn't it sometimes?
With those trees.'

Clarence: 'Oh god, yes.
Yes.'

Nina: 'I've never seen so many perch in one tree.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Facing basically west, aren't they?'

Nina: 'Mm.
That's true.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Look at that pigeon'

Clarence: '[UNK] pardon?'

Nina: 'sat there.'

Clarence: 'Yes.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'The windows are filthy outside [UNK].'

Clarence: 'Mm.
You don't often get one pigeon though do you?
[UNK] There's usually at least two of them.'

Nina: 'Well you usually have two together don't you?'

Clarence: 'Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'Ooh that door!'

Clarence: 'Yes that was getting on my wick that door, yeah. [UNK]'

Nina: 'Shut up door!'

Clarence: 'Mm.
I was bunged up before I started this.
[UNK] bunged up now.'

Nina: 'I wonder who I wonder who chopped and vandalized all those daffodils round the corner? [UNK]?'

Clarence: 'Well and the fact that it was just their garden, and as far as I can make out it was simply that garden, it would suggest that she's fallen out with some kids or something like that or somebody and yeah.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'I mean why pick on one garden and systematically'

Nina: 'Well they probably thing, yes but cabbages?
Fancy taking cabbages!'

Clarence: 'I don't think they'd been actually taken from what I can gather.'

Nina: 'Well what did they do to them?
Oh just cut them?'

Clarence: 'They slashed them about, yes.
Cut them all.
Mm.'

Nina: 'Peculiar thing to do.'

Clarence: 'Oh according to Josie, I really don't know about all the cabbages, it might consist of one or two.
Funny business, yeah.'

Nina: 'Oh it's a shame though isn't it?'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'All the time you spend waiting for the blooming things to grow.'

Clarence: 'That's Yvonne's mother isn't it?
Yeah.'

Nina: 'That's right.'

Clarence: 'Didn't Yvonne say she can be an awkward old devil?'

Nina: 'Oh I don't know.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
So I sh'

Clarence: 'yes.
She's probably fallen out with some kid or other.'

Nina: 'You can't be sure of that.'

Clarence: 'Oh no no no no no.
If there'd been a trail of destruction down the road, then fair enough, but'

Nina: 'I couldn't er go and vandalize something, I mean a thing like flowers.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'They're so nice that'

Clarence: 'Well we think so.
Obviously there's others that don't think so, but not everybody thinks so.'

Nina: 'Well a lot of people like, I mean most people like flowers don't they?'

Clarence: 'Yes.'

Nina: 'Whether you grow them or not's a difference [UNK] but most people'

Clarence: 'Yeah, yeah.
Oh true, true.
They're not an ug ugly thing.'

Nina: 'like them.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'And I couldn't go and vandalize something that was nice.'

Clarence: 'No.
No.'

Nina: 'There's some peculiar minds some people have don't they?'

Clarence: 'Oh yeah it's very small beer really isn't it?
Compared to some of the dodges they get up to.'

Nina: 'It is really.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Have you decided whereabouts you're going to put that light at the front?'

Clarence: 'Light?
Er well no the, well at the front.
Other than that, over the door area somewhere, I don't know exactly.
I might stick it on a flying lead and wander around with it for a bit and see where it's best.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'But I've got a rough idea where it'll go anyway.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: '[UNK] of course is cable running to it providing it with power.
I'll probably run it from the garage [UNK].'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'About the easiest source.'

Nina: 'On the corner I think would be perhaps a good idea, do you think?
[UNK] Between the garage and the house.'

Clarence: 'Do you mean the return?
If you come from the front of the house going towards the garage, that little bit there?
There's two feet or something [UNK].'

Nina: 'No.
I thought you were going to put it facing the front.'

Clarence: 'I am, yes.
Well what do you mean then, the corner?'

Nina: 'On the co on the front of the house at the corner.'

Clarence: 'Yes [UNK], you mean literally on the corner?
The apex of two'

Nina: 'Yes.'

Clarence: 'Well I'd have to make something to mount it on to go right on the corner but'

Nina: 'Well I know that.
Well wherever you put it you're going to have to make something to mount it on.'

Clarence: 'No.
No.
No.
No.'

Nina: 'Why?'

Clarence: 'It'll screw drive on to a flat surface.
Brickwork.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Certainly it will.
Yeah.
Mm.'

Nina: 'How high up are you thinking of putting it?'

Clarence: 'Above a vandal.'

Nina: 'How high [UNK].
How high is the one we've got at the back?'

Clarence: 'Well so you've got to get up a ladder to get at it.
Er up a step ladder I mean, not a'

Nina: 'I think about, above the number.'

Clarence: 'I'd thought roughly speaking in that area, yes but'

Nina: 'Er yes, well somewhere there.'

Clarence: 'Ah well that would illuminate the er see if I put it fairly close to the actual corner at the front side, going down towards the garage.
Close to that corner, still lighting on the front face but'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'then a percentage of light will go round the corner.
Well [UNK] cos lights don't go round corners but'

Nina: 'What about on the garage above what about on the garage?'

Clarence: 'No.'

Nina: 'No?'

Clarence: 'No that would throw the front door into shadow wouldn't it?'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'Well above the number then.
Cos you're nearly, you know, more or less on the corner there anyway aren't you?'

Clarence: 'Mm like I say that would be mm.
[UNK] Oh that way I can then get a decent cable run I think to the garage.
For feed, you know?'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Well that's the easiest bit, [UNK].
To the [UNK] circuit, yeah.'

Nina: 'What's that then?'

Clarence: 'That is [UNK].
It will be helpful though, having a light there.'

Nina: 'Oh yes.'

Clarence: 'Because at night, you get a percentage a a'

Nina: 'Yes you do.'

Clarence: 'degree of light I should say from that street lighting, but not an awful lot.'

Nina: 'Not the same, no.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'No it is handy having the light.'

Clarence: 'And for people coming in, going out for the step.'

Nina: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: '[UNK] whatever, you know?
Mm.'

Clarence: 'It'll be a quite sufficient spread to, to cope with the er entrance to the garage I mean, you know?
Mm.
I still think two rows of erm pavers stones inbetween's the best bet for the front you know?
To put there.
There's only one problem'

Nina: 'You mean to the garage?'

Clarence: 'Well the approach to the garage, yeah.
The drive.'

Nina: 'Like Mike's got at, in their [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Er yes.
Yes.
Exactly.
Yeah.
The usual thing, yeah.'

Nina: 'Well you get a erm'

Clarence: 'You get a what?'

Nina: 'You get a lot of weeds where the chippings are.'

Clarence: 'No, not if you put sodium chlorate down.
Nothing'll grow then.
Good grief.'

Nina: 'The thing is if you'

Clarence: 'If you what?'

Nina: 'erm I'm just thinking if, like when anybody comes to stay'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'and you run the car, or somebody runs the car the other way'

Clarence: 'Up the sides, yeah.
Yeah? [UNK]'

Nina: 'Well then you're going across, you're not staying st er you're not on the pavers are you?'

Clarence: 'No, well that doesn't really matter.
I mean the erm in fact, there's only one fairly tight path you can follow to get the car in.
Into the side.
If you think about it.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'It'll be worth putting a couple of pavers on there just to cope with the track of the pa er the wheels going in.'

Nina: 'Oh wouldn't that look a bit odd?'

Clarence: 'Not necessarily, no.
No.
I don't mean put down like bloody tramlines.'

Nina: 'What, like I have down the garden there?'

Clarence: 'A railway line in.
No no.
Actually it's quite attractive'

Nina: 'A walk you know walk'

Clarence: 'that actually.'

Nina: 'Well it is but it'

Clarence: 'I was looking at it again this morning.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'I thought that.'

Clarence: 'Ooh [UNK] hark at her!'

Nina: 'Yes.
Well I think some of the bricks could when you decide wha which you're going to use and which you, mm.'

Clarence: 'Well they want stabilizing a bit yeah and er'

Nina: 'I'll get some of those bricks up and put the stone things down cos they look better.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.
Mhm.'

Nina: 'As long as I can get, walk along and get to all the plants there.
What do you think of that [UNK]?
I'd definitely think about moving those other pavers at the bottom.
There we were the steps are.'

Clarence: 'Oh lifting them you mean? [UNK] you mean?
Oh god.'

Nina: 'Yeah [UNK].
That would make th give it a better erm'

Clarence: 'Yes.
Yeah.'

Nina: 'I don't see any reason for that, to be quite honest, why they've done that?'

Clarence: 'Well there was at the time obviously.
Cos do you remember there was that erm monstrous creation I should say erection, erection for erm'

Nina: 'Oh I know that.
Well there's still some of those stones at, underneath that [UNK].'

Clarence: 'The foundation, exactly.
I know, yeah.'

Nina: 'We've got to move those before we grow anything.'

Nina: 'I've put some of the bricks over one side, so that'll eliminate getting rid of one side of them.'

Clarence: 'No, I'm not with you.'

Nina: 'Well where I've put me bricks they're'

Clarence: 'Yes.'

Nina: 'on top of some of those stones that are underneath.'

Clarence: 'I'm with you now.
It's fairly deep [UNK] eight inches down, the bricks?'

Nina: 'I know.'

Clarence: 'I know I went quite a way down.'

Nina: 'You did.'

Clarence: 'I mean honestly you'd have thought they were building a ruddy house there wouldn't you?'

Nina: 'I wonder what they did it for?'

Clarence: 'That's only er I don't know.
It's the same with the greenhouse'

Nina: 'It was a right monstrosity that thing wasn't it?'

Clarence: 'They'd have had a nine inch thick'

Clarence: 'erm solid concrete path in the centre.
Who the hell'

Nina: 'I know!'

Clarence: 'wants that?
In the middle of the co'

Nina: 'Stupid.'

Clarence: 'er of the greenhouse.'

Nina: 'Talking about stones, we'll have to have a trip up to the erm'

Nina: 'that er yard to see if [UNK].
You know when we went to see about the flagstones?'

Clarence: 'Oh there?
Yes, yes.'

Nina: 'I've not seen any there's not been any more in erm workmen in [UNK].
It's a good idea that, going up there.'

Clarence: 'Well oh dear.
I've kept my eyes open [UNK] when we're going through Harford'

Nina: 'No sign?'

Clarence: 'and there's no signs of work.
Mark you it wasn't a brilliant day was it?
So'

Nina: 'No it wasn't.
Well we just have, must have just missed them.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.'

Clarence: 'Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.
Cos those were definitely new ones, ready for placing in.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'A, a pile of stones.
Oh yeah.'

Nina: 'So the old ones they'd have taken back to that yard place wouldn't they?'

Clarence: 'Well no.
No no, no.'

Nina: 'What do they do with them?'

Clarence: 'No, straight to the tip.'

Nina: 'Well that's the place that'

Clarence: 'That's not the tip.'

Nina: 'Where we went?'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
That's not the tip.'

Nina: 'Well which was the tip?'

Clarence: 'You've never been to the tip.
I don't think, no you've not.'

Nina: 'Oh.'

Clarence: 'It's erm Tearscross way.
You know the quarry?
Well the quarry area anyway, the same road.'

Nina: 'Oh so I've never'

Clarence: 'You can approach it two ways.
From erm'

Nina: 'I thought it was there.'

Nina: 'They had a lot of stones there'

Clarence: 'No no no.'

Nina: 'didn't they?'

Clarence: 'That's just bits they've had on various trucks.
Lorries and things.'

Nina: 'Oh.'

Clarence: 'No, no.'

Nina: 'Oh I see.'

Clarence: 'No no.
The tip is where I went.
The first time I went I followed the route recommended by Peter?
Peter which on a map looks quicker but it isn't cos it's a winding'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'country road single track in a lot of directions.'

Nina: 'Do they just heave the bricks?
They just heave them?
They don't'

Clarence: 'Apparently yes.'

Nina: 'sell them off or anything?'

Clarence: 'No.
No they don't they just they stick them on to'

Nina: 'Mm.
They'd serve our purpose very well there'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Nina: 'because there's such an awful lot to do.'

Clarence: 'Mm.'

Nina: 'We could bring them right well the two that are down there could come [UNK]'

Clarence: 'Yeah.'

Nina: 'It would save you a lot of cementing wouldn't it?'

Clarence: 'On indeed it would, yes.
It would.'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
I'll be giving that mixer a caning this year though.'

Nina: 'Pardon?'

Clarence: 'I hope to give the mixer a caning this year.'

Nina: 'I hope you do too.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
Mm.'

Nina: '[UNK] wondering what to do next.'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Oh yes, yes.'

Nina: 'When you come to think of it though it's s to me it makes sense to start at the top where we have done and work your way down doesn't it?'

Clarence: 'In some ways it is sensible, yes because you're carrying muck down.'

Nina: 'Well of course you are.'

Clarence: 'Yeah.
I mean down, when we've done down here we've pu god been putting mats down and lord knows what to'

Nina: 'Mm.'

Clarence: 'oh yeah.
Mm.
But the erm ceiling rose and preferably the light switch could do with replacing [UNK].'

Nina: 'Oh I know the ce oh the ceiling rose, they're horrible those old things, aren't they?'

Clarence: 'Mm.
Well the, the lighting switch isn't so clever either.'

Nina: 'No.'

Clarence: 'And before I put too much back I want to have the floorboards up to clear'
