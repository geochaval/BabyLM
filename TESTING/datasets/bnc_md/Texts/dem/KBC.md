You get paid for playing er, you don't ha or you have very few scores, you don't have line-outs and basically you tackle about a hundred million times a game.
So basically you just run at them all the time.'

Audrey: 'Fresh orange.'

Gordon: 'I see.
So the rules are a bit different then?'

Kevin: 'Oh yeah, they are quite significantly different.'

Kevin: 'But I know a lad that's physio for Wigan'

Kevin: 'just Xs at the bottom of the contract.
They can't write.
Crazy!
But they do, they get paid a lot of money but only for a short period of time.'

Gordon: 'It has, it's got worse'

Audrey: 'No grass on ours.'

Gordon: 'over the years.
The more I put into it the worse it goes.'

Kevin: 'I think it does, d'ya, I think like when you scarify it and things like that all you do is produce open ground for weeds to grow in.'

Elaine: 'Well no, you have to scarify it and then you have to you have to carry on the work, you can't sort of do it and then think, ooh I'll leave it for a couple of months.'

Audrey: 'No.
I'm thinking of writing myself you know, to Karen.'

Gordon: 'Oh no you can't do that!'

Audrey: 'I, I can.'

Gordon: 'Because I don't mind if Karen writes and bloody blames us that it's our bloody fault, I'm not bothered.'

Audrey: 'No, I just feel that er'

Gordon: 'You don't wanna do that.'

Audrey: 'I mean we'

Gordon: 'It'll upset her that.'

Audrey: 'she's obviously er very upset, and I, I mean, I just don't want that, she's such a nice girl.
You know, like I really don't I, I just thought perhaps a note from me you know, apologizing.'

Gordon: 'Why not, [UNK] get a note from Karen apologizing for being a, I had the hump.'

Audrey: 'Yeah.
I thought, well a note from both of us really.'

Gordon: 'Well I don't think she, and she, Karen wouldn't want that because well it, it's nothing to do with us.

We're sticking our er oar in where we shouldn't.
And so the other he's there if you want isn't he?
I mean'

Audrey: 'Well I know that.'

Gordon: 'You can't stick your oar in like that to her at any old time can you, really?'

Audrey: 'No.'

Gordon: 'Well you could have stuck, you know, seven or eight years of age you couldn't even do it then in case it hurt the kid's mother or something like that, or whatever it was.
She's nearly an adult.
Well and truly!
Getting an old man now, never mind [UNK].'

Audrey: 'Well I know that.
I know, but'

Gordon: 'Well it's, it's not our, it's not our er, we'll be just sticking our nose in where it's not necessarily wanted.'

Audrey: 'Yes but it was our mistake in the first place.'

Gordon: 'Well it wasn't really was it?
Obviously, I mean I know you're arguing with her but er but if he'd, if he'd have go if we got a christian name that night it wouldn't have gone down as either of those Karen or Fran.'

Audrey: 'I know well we could have found out quite easily.'

Gordon: 'Oh aye.
That's a different story.
Yes.
We could have found out.
We could have phoned Amy and found out there and then virtually, but I think we said oh, I, summat like i i it's not worth bothering about, don't matter just put [UNK].'

Audrey: 'But it did matter didn't it?'

Gordon: 'It did matter but we didn't know that at the time did we?'

Audrey: 'Oh no we didn't.'

Gordon: 'It'll be worse now, in retrospect, it'll worse phoning Amy up at that moment and asking what the name was.
And he could have put it down while he was here.
Cos he didn't know the name that night [UNK].'

Audrey: 'Oh I know he didn't.
I know that.
But the thing was, what I, what I was ge getting to last night, is that we didn't bring the name into it, the surname.

Gordon: 'Mm.'

Audrey: 'Anyhow it's alright now.

Gordon: 'Yeah.'

Audrey: 'Oh dear.'

Gordon: 'No.'

Audrey: 'They, they just come out wi a er'

Gordon: 'With statements.'

Audrey: 'glibly with these, these statements.'

Gordon: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Audrey: 'I'm sure that e e if there is an easy way of doing it the Conservatives would have found out and done it.
I don't think there's any any easy way.
I don't see how they're going to do it.'

Gordon: 'No.'

Audrey: 'I really don't.
I mean where are they going, where are they going to get the extra money from er to pay for the old aged pensioners' er eight pound rise?'

Gordon: 'Mm.'

Audrey: 'Or so they say, we'll get eight pound.
Somebody's got to pay for it.
So it'll be the working people, er, probably the the national er, health stamp'll have to go, go up.
It'll be a sorry day if they get in.
It will Gordon.
Oh!
I don't know.
You're a real turncoat you are.'

Gordon: 'Mm.'

Audrey: 'Aren't you?'

Gordon: 'Mm.'

Audrey: 'I was listening today to erm a man on the radio and he was only thirty four and he had a stroke and they were saying he, they er, they were asking him, they said well how did it happen?
They said, did you have any warning?
And he said no.
None at all he said.
I was gardening and he said er er I bent over to do something and he said I just went dizzy, he said, and I fell over he said and then I realized my right side was paralysed.
And he said I was completely confused and I couldn't, he said I was trying to shout my wife and erm and, er, you know my mouth wouldn't work, he said, but she said fortunately she looked through the window and er found him and they took him to hospital.
And they were saying, they were saying that, you know, you associate strokes with older people, but there's a hundred young people a week have strokes!'

Gordon: 'Tt.'

Audrey: 'Aye.
And he said erm like it's the clots to your brains that erm that cause it, you know.
They said, well did you have any warning about it?
And he said er, no, he said I didn't think I had he said, but now, he said I realized that how I, was forgetting er I'd be talking and I'd forget sort of what I was just talking about that split second.'

Gordon: 'Mm.'

Audrey: 'And now the stroke has affected him that way.
He can be talking, say about a well, you know, about any er, about sa say a, a video recorder or something like that'

Gordon: 'Mm.'

Audrey: 'and for a minute he can forget that he's talking about it.'

Gordon: 'Mm.'

Audrey: 'You know, but erm he sa he's recovered reasonably well in the same, you know, but'

Gordon: 'Got his use'

Gordon: 'I know!'

Audrey: 'I mean you just don't you don't imagine that do you really?'

Gordon: 'No.'

Audrey: 'It's terrible!
But a hundred young people a week!

Gordon: 'That's terrible!'

Audrey: 'It is.
It's an awful thing.'

Gordon: 'See I've never, I've never across anyone that like know you.'

Audrey: 'What do you mean?'

Gordon: 'Well I've known anyone to be five years and no use whatsoever.'

Audrey: 'Ah well, and Aun I mean Aunty Lilly was like that Gordon.
She never got her use back and she never spoke again.'

Gordon: 'Yeah but she didn't, well she didn't live long after her stroke did she?'

Audrey: 'Oh she did, you know.
Er, not as'

Gordon: 'Mind, she was in bed all the time.'

Audrey: 'Oh she was in bed all the time.
Yes.'

Gordon: 'How long did she live after the stroke?
Only months weren't it?'

Audrey: 'Oh no!
Oh no!
It wasn't months Gordon.
No.
I mean she was in Park Hospital for so long and then she was transferred to a nursing home in Thornton.
Er do yo don't you remember us ta taking Iris and Ian down to see her?'

Gordon: 'I didn't see her did I?'

Audrey: 'No we didn't go in, but Iris and Ian did.'

Gordon: 'Did he?'

Audrey: 'Yes.
Well I, I, we, I, I drove them there.
You was with me.'

Gordon: 'Well, you know, I can't recall any of this.'

Audrey: 'Yes.'

Gordon: 'Did we, we go to Edith's to see her then did we not?'

Audrey: 'No, but I went to Park Hospital to see her.
Because Edith now Edith was going away for some unknown reason, I don't know, she must have been going on another holiday anyhow.
No, she was in Park Hospital a long time.
That was it, because Edith was going on another holiday and she was er, she wanted someone to go and visit er Lilly, and I said well I'll go.
And I, I, it was when I had my own car and I drove there.
And I wanted to see her.
She was very, very frustrated cos she couldn't speak.'

Gordon: 'Mm!'

Audrey: 'And she couldn't write anything down.
I don't think you saw her actually.'

Gordon: 'I don't think I did.
I never recall seeing her when she was ill.
Never.'

Audrey: 'No.
No.'

Gordon: 'Well you must have been going during the day while I was at work then.'

Audrey: 'No, it was night time I went, cos I was working.'

Gordon: 'Well why in the bloody hell I didn't go then?
Why didn't I go with you?'

Audrey: 'I don't know.'

Gordon: 'Was it night school or something like that, or what?
I don't know.'

Audrey: 'I think you we d'ya know I think you were at night school Gordon when I think about it.
I think you were teaching at night school.'

Gordon: 'It must have been something I was doing.'

Audrey: 'No!

Because the ba the children were small.
Yo one of us had to stay in.'

Gordon: 'Oh yes.
Aye, that's right.

Gordon: 'Well I was only at Lillycups from August seventy till August seventy one.'

Audrey: 'Yes.'

Gordon: 'Only a year.

Audrey: 'Yes.

Gordon: 'Just a couple'

Audrey: 'So'

Gordon: 'of months after we got that'

Audrey: 'I think it was because er th cos we'd got Iris' er er Triumph didn't we?'

Audrey: 'Yeah.'

Gordon: 'All, and what you did and when I got the car, the date and when you got that Triumph then.'

Audrey: 'Yeah.'

Gordon: 'You know, little, just a line.
And then when you look at it er ca you can recall then'

Audrey: 'Oh yes.'

Gordon: 'other things.'

Audrey: 'That's right.
The one line sort of sets it all off, you can remember.'

Gordon: 'That's right.
Yeah.'

Audrey: 'Mm.
Yes but I remember, I can remember Edith phoning me and, and saying, you know she was going away, you know is, you know could I go down?
And I said yes.'

Gordon: 'Mm.'

Audrey: 'I, cos I remember coming, coming back, I got lost.
You know where er that circle is where there's the shops, well instead of taking I know, instead of taking one road I took another and I got completely lost!'

Gordon: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Audrey: 'I wouldn't now, but then I, I, I didn't know er round that area.'

Gordon: 'No that's right really, I mean if you don't know the area you don't know which road to take on the islands.'

Audrey: 'I know.
But I mean, you wouldn't have thought that Ed er Lilly, I mean, she had no weight on her or anything like'

Gordon: 'No.'

Audrey: 'that did she?'

Gordon: 'No.
She's always been active all her life.'

Audrey: 'All, been active all her life.
No, you can't understand how these things happen.'

Gordon: 'Well they give you all these bloody tips and papers about what to do, to avoid this and avoid that.'

Audrey: 'And what to eat and everything but'

Gordon: 'This bloody footballer, I mean it's a'

Audrey: 'I know!'

Gordon: 'a really fit man.'

Audrey: 'I know.'

Gordon: 'He's, er, one artery was seventy percent blocked, it was in the paper.'

Audrey: 'Yeah.'

Gordon: 'And the other artery was ninety percent blocked.'

Audrey: 'Was it really?'

Gordon: 'Yeah!
Yeah!'

Audrey: 'Good God!'

Gordon: 'I mean, he could have gone an any time.'

Audrey: 'Graham Sounness, I mean he's only thirty eight!'

Gordon: 'Could have gone any time with with nothing through his bloody arteries!'

Audrey: 'Good God!
But that's incred I didn't know it was that bad.'

Gordon: 'It was in the paper this morning.
And er'

Audrey: 'Goodness me!'

Gordon: 'Well he's a, he, he didn't smoke.'

Audrey: 'No.
He was an athlete.'

Gordon: 'He's been an athlete.
He obviously ate like everybody else.'

Audrey: 'Mm.
And he'

Gordon: 'I mean'

Audrey: 'wasn't overweight in any way.'

Gordon: 'Wasn't overweight, what more [UNK]'

Audrey: 'No.'

Gordon: 'the bloody hell do you have to do!'

Audrey: 'That's incredible that!'

Gordon: 'See they say it was a ma it's hereditary.'

Audrey: 'Well'

Gordon: 'Cos his father had a bypass didn't he?'

Audrey: 'Oh did he?'

Gordon: 'I think some other relative died er'

Audrey: 'Oh.'

Gordon: 'youngish.'

Audrey: 'Yes.
Oh well I bet, I think perhaps it is really.
I know.'

Gordon: 'It's still going?'

Audrey: 'I know.
Yeah, and you can't, you can't understand it can you really?
Well look at the old lady that walks past here at ninety one!'

Gordon: 'That's right, yeah.
Yeah.'

Audrey: 'And she does all her own shopping.'

Gordon: 'Mm.'

Audrey: 'You know, I mean, she keeps stopping but she's, she's remarkable!
She really is.'

Gordon: 'Mm.'

Audrey: 'But they're few and far between aren't they?
When th you're like that.'

Gordon: 'Yeah.'

Audrey: 'Mm.'

Gordon: 'But what I couldn't understand with this Soun this fella that'

Audrey: 'This Sounness?'

Gordon: 'Aye.
He, he found out cos he went for, to, for a check up and they took his blood pressure.'

Audrey: 'Yes.'

Gordon: 'And tha well lots of people go and have blood pressure taken, they find it's high, and they'

Audrey: 'Yes.'

Gordon: 'give them tablets.'

Audrey: 'Yes.'

Gordon: 'Go home.
Why did they take it a stage further with him?
He'd got high blood pressure, he wasn't in any pain he's living a normal life.
Similar to what I was when I went.'

Audrey: 'Yes.'

Gordon: 'And they just give me tablets.'

Audrey: 'Yes.'

Gordon: 'Now why, what made them take it to the stage'

Audrey: 'Well er well, first'

Gordon: 'where, he wanted a heart bypass?'

Audrey: 'first and foremost he was in a private scheme.'

Gordon: 'Well, pro probably that's it then.'

Audrey: 'Yeah.
A and probably because i because of his father and er the rela the other relative having the bypasses done.
So they took it'

Gordon: 'Mm.'

Audrey: 'a step further, but I think probably, it's because he was in er er a private scheme.'

Gordon: 'Very likely innit?'

Audrey: 'Yes.'

Gordon: 'So there's a lot of people walking about with just taking bloody tablets who probably really should have a by bypass.'

Audrey: 'Ah well I, well, I wouldn't say that really Gordon.
I mean I think er, when your blood pressure was found out and you'd been taking tablets ever, so, I think it's kept it all under control and you've, you, we eat a sensible diet.
The only, the only er thing I complained about with you is, is the butter.'

Gordon: 'Mm.
I don't have that much now.'

Audrey: 'But I think everything in moderation, but you don't eat as much butter now as what you used to.'

Gordon: 'I don't eat that much bread you see.'

Audrey: 'No.
So I, I think really, and I think what I think with him, I think definitely I think it must be the private scheme and plus that his own family, it runs in the family.'

Gordon: 'Mm mm.
Must be hell of a shock being told'

Audrey: 'Oh God!
It must have been.
See how much it's costing?
Two hundred and fifty pounds a night!'

Gordon: 'Yeah.'

Audrey: 'Phworgh!
That's without the operation.'

Gordon: 'Yeah.
Well he earned three hundred and fifty thousand a year then.'

Audrey: 'Oh I know.
And plus he's, he, he, he, he married an heiress you know.'

Gordon: 'Did he?'

Audrey: 'Er him er, sh they live in Spain now.
Oh er he, he's worth a pretty penny is Sounness.
He went in Carl's shop the other, the other week.'

Gordon: 'Did he?'

Audrey: 'Yes!
Mm.
Must have been looking for a house.
Carl said he, he looked er well er, his face did, it were very he's got a very poxy skin.'

Gordon: 'Has he?'

Audrey: 'You kno mm.
Yes.
He was having it done this afternoon weren't he?'

Gordon: 'Yeah.
Some time today.
Aye.'

Audrey: 'I tell you what, that's quick int it though Gordon?
With only going in last night and'

Gordon: 'Mm.'

Audrey: 'having it done today.'

Gordon: 'It is indeed.'

Audrey: 'We I wonder how quick they would have got him in though if he wouldn't have been in a private scheme.'

Gordon: 'He could wait six months couldn't he?'

Audrey: 'Well he could have been dead by then.'

Gordon: 'Well er, yeah, e exactly that's what they're moaning about int it?'

Audrey: 'Terrible!'

Gordon: 'Put them on a list and wait.
I've never heard so much talk about health as we do nowadays.'

Audrey: 'Oh I know.'

Gordon: 'When I was young I co I don't remember talking all the time about bloody health and what you should do and what you shouldn't do.'

Audrey: 'No I know.'

Gordon: 'Did you?'

Audrey: 'No.
But we weren't educated in, in, in health though.'

Gordon: 'We just li we just lived and that was the end of it.'

Audrey: 'Yes but then you see, in the ol in the old days Gordon, I mean, you we you were very fortunate if you got three meals a day and i and whatever you got you were glad of and used to eat it all.
Now we're much more affluent and people are educated we er'

Gordon: 'Mm.'

Audrey: 'as regards their health.'

Gordon: 'Mhm.'

Audrey: 'Well th having said that Gordon, your mother lived to a good old age, and my mum, and my father did.'

Gordon: 'Yeah.'

Audrey: 'And they ate all the wrong stuff didn't they?'

Gordon: 'According to wha according to what they say now they did.'

Audrey: 'Mm.
I know.
Don't know who to believe really.'

Gordon: 'When you look at, when you look at the some, all these, a lot of these composers and artists who died long ago and you look the birth range there's a hell of a lot at seventy five, seventy six'

Audrey: 'Yes.'

Gordon: 'a oh there's a few at forty odd.'

Audrey: 'Mm.'

Gordon: 'But there's a hell of a lot well into their seventies.
You know, and they were born early eighteen hundreds.'

Audrey: 'Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
I know.'

Gordon: 'I know we're living longer now generally but I wonder how much'

Audrey: 'I don't know I'

Gordon: 'I wonder'

Audrey: 'you know'

Gordon: 'how much, how much, I don't really know.
Cos there's more people now than there was in those days.'

Audrey: 'Yeah, there's a lot more people.
It's not anyhow, I mean, it's alright living longer if you, if you, if you've got all your faculties.'

Gordon: 'Mm.'

Audrey: 'And you've got good health and everything.
It's no use living like a cabbage, I don't think so anyhow.'

Gordon: 'No, that's'

Audrey: 'And when I see these people in nursing homes all sat round a wall in chairs oh God!
I'd hate to end up like that.'

Gordon: 'Somebody's [UNK].'

Audrey: 'Pardon?'

Gordon: 'Left the gate open.'

Audrey: 'Did you?
I wonder who's that?'

Gordon: 'I'll check.
Has a leaflet come through.'

Audrey: 'Yes.
I bet there has.
Tell you what, the Conservative candidate's not been round has he?'

Gordon: 'No he daren't.'
