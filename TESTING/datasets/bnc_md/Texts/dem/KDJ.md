[UNK]: 'If I get him to go in there and do a bit of plaster on'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'eh? what I was thinking of doing was getting a, have a go aye you know builders merchant, pick up some plaster if its a wet day and start doing some plastering in there'

Pauline: 'yeah, well it looks through erm need to use it soon isn't it?'

Bob: 'I well I reckon, the trouble is, it depends on how things go in the next couple of weeks'

Pauline: 'you can'

Pauline: 'the opposite, you can start as many within the original firms'

Bob: 'anybody's [UNK]'

Pauline: 'yeah'

Bob: 'that's right'

Pauline: 'see I was thinking this was gonna cost a lot, a lot of money to put the phone's in, but its not, because you just put one line in and then put different bits up the line don't you?'

Bob: 'no no they come in, in separate lines'

Pauline: 'but you cut it'

Bob: 'you charge pair, you'll charge pair in here, its not just one line with four connections, they charge you per phone'

Pauline: 'I was talking to Desmond about it and he reckons that once you've got your line you can muck about and'

Bob: 'no'

Pauline: 'put quite a few lines in there'

Bob: 'no, dunne work like that'

Pauline: 'oh'

Bob: 'you can use the same, you can use the same number alright?'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'eh, the same number on four lines, but if were want to go out four people were to phone in at the one time'

Pauline: 'oh of course yeah'

Bob: 'do you see what I mean?'

Pauline: 'I see what you mean, yeah of course you do'

Bob: 'you've got to have four separate lines'

Pauline: 'yeah exactly the same sort of thing with the front room one and the kitchen one you just did'

Bob: 'that's right'

Pauline: 'yeah'

Bob: 'right, and then once your in, you can put, you can put in as many extensions up as you want'

Pauline: 'yes'

Bob: 'but what I'm talking about dear, probably in'

Bob: 'I'm talking you'

Bob: 'aren't we?,
I'm talking about cord and five lines here for the minute aye and I'm talking about bringing in talking about bringing in four or five lines down there, right?'

Pauline: 'mm, mm'

Bob: 'and there's not any reason why once your in you canne put another couple of lines in, and you can even put a couple of lines in on a different number if you want'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'but still have to four phone in for the same purpose, are you with me?'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'you could run them all end up with numbers'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'but really I've got to talk to somebody, I've got to talk to somebody for their'

Pauline: 'British Telecom'

Bob: 'British Telecom about it'

Pauline: 'because, yes that's true, the'

Bob: 'but there's a right time and a wrong time for doing it, see cos basically if you were getting the money, the phone calls that were, that were done a since Christmas right, I'm not sure how the bill runs, it probably runs December, January, February er I think they run a quarter on the phone bill, and its a three month period'

Pauline: 'that's right, were gonna get a phone bill soon'

Bob: 'so I'll be getting that phone bill within the next fortnight, right, but bear in mind June June and December we weren't really doing anything for three weeks'

Pauline: 'yeah'

Bob: 'right, and its only the last couple of weeks that we've really picked up'

Bob: 'yeah, hopefully the business coming in of, of this month because of the fact that the, the volume of business bound to be higher'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'right alright? and then what you do is, if you run a four phones, four or five phones through up top, for the next quarter, right'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'be getting a result if you stepped in with another four phones, new lines, you'd have the use of these four lines for three month, to generate business before you get out with first phone bill on them, right so that you could drop er the lines here if you wanted, at er, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter whether you've got one line or whether you've got a hundred lines'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'if you've got one line and its costing you money'

Pauline: 'yeah, yeah'

Bob: 'a hundred lines losing money is going to cost you a lot of money'

Pauline: 'yeah its all wrong'

Bob: 'if you've got one line making you money and you've got a hundred lines, a hundred lines is gonna make you a hundred times more, do, do you see what I mean?'

Pauline: 'yeah'

Bob: 'your lines are either working and making you money or there working and costing you money, and the supervisor's job is to make sure that whoever's working these phone's is getting a result'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'right the more phone's used is somebody that is capable of making'

Bob: 'for you'

Pauline: 'yeah'

Bob: 'right, now what you've got to judge at the end of the day, now lets say for instance that you've put in six lines six lines, right and you only wanted to use two of them all you've got a number for is the rental charge isn't it?'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'so you only pick up your gain and drop your gain back'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'right, so if I'm carrying six at the minute, you've got to say to yourself its stupid having six here'

Bob: 'then only having four up there and that place is twice the size'

Pauline: 'yeah, what's it cost to put a line in?, its about a hundred pound now'

Bob: 'you see, if you put a line it costs you about a hundred a thirty quid now I think, but according to what they tell me, once a line has been in for a year if you put a line in, you've got to pay the first year, its gotta be in for a year, if you have it taken out before the year, you'll still be due for the rental on it'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'as far as I can gather, I don't know, I'd imagine where a line has a minimum period of three months rental'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'right, and another thing is whether we want phone's, because all these phone's are rented the actual phone's'

Pauline: 'yeah'

Bob: 'right, they haven't nee got spare four phone's'

Pauline: 'yeah'

Bob: 'you can pick up phone's that cheap these days, probably for about fifteen quid for er, have a decent phone'

Pauline: 'yeah,'

Bob: 'right and there why, why, I mean I'm not saying, at the end of the day its all taxed up towards you making money'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'now ideally what I'd like to do is to have a chat with somebody, a'

Pauline: 'cos we could do with these phones, of like, I don't know yet, exactly how it works, but, but the one you've got the headphones on'

Bob: 'that's right, that'll be a much better system to work'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'but I don't think Telecom's up to dating things, Telecom keeps rabbitting on about how clever they are at doing this'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'that and the next thing and that'

Pauline: 'and Mercury's no nearer'

Bob: 'Mercury's no nearer see'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'erm, quite frankly I'm looking to have something like probably a, that's twelve, sixteen phones working this thing next year'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'there's no any reason why you shouldn't eh?'

Bob: 'you work out how much business you'll be doing with sixteen phones'

Pauline: 'oh yeah, I know what your saying Bob'

Bob: 'I mean were working with five at the minute, we'll go to that place and double it up to say ten and by this time next, next year there's not any reason why it shouldn't be more to sixteen'

Pauline: 'mm'

Bob: 'and also'

Pauline: 'I'll just go and check this is'

Pauline: 'alright?'

Bob: 'go on then'

## 041202

[UNK]: 'Ah I don't know whether you want me to chat on about that'

Pauline: 'Yeah talk to it about, in general terms'

Bob: 'Right that depends on how general you're talking about, does er, eh so that gives you an idea there, when I was working with them'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'here are my targets for the period, right?'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'And that's percentages and everything'

Pauline: 'Can I have a look?'

Bob: 'Aye have a look, while you're doing that I'll have a look at what bits and pieces see if I talk to you for a minute about these'

Bob: 'right'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'somebody's going to have to spend a bit of time with them over the week about the presume I'm gonna have the time'

Pauline: 'That's right, it's'

Bob: 'and it might be better for me to do it, see you've got a'

Bob: 'there's various things you can talk to them about, and all you do is, all you're looking for is some key words to motivate them, right eh er to a certain extent you want, you want to assume from the start that they don't have a clue what they're doing'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'right, now, I mean that's the basis that I start with June excuse me, now that's the basis you said didn't we?'

Pauline: 'Everybody that starts'

Bob: 'Everybody, now you've also got to accept the high percentage of having nay got a clue, eh what they're doing, even after a week or a couple of weeks and it shouldn't er be here, but if you get somebody, nice er Michelle or Cathy, eh, or eh Adel'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'now they can only push you, they can use a certain amount of their own imagination, right, but they cannot really push your information unless it's been fed to them, so somebody's, somebody's got it, do you follow me?
Go and lay it in there'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'because at the end of the day other who come in and start are gonna listen and see what they do'

Pauline: 'That's right'

Bob: 'so the more strength you've got in it, that, that you'

Bob: 'basically, eh, the more, you know, the better the result you're going to get now I think it's, no I don't think so so you're gonna have to concentrate on, on the actual'

Pauline: 'Selling'

Bob: 'selling and getting a result on that you see I've covered a lot of stuff for you on that, I've covered quite a bit with you on, er product knowledge, now would you say that you're reasonably together there and where you want to be on product knowledge?'

Pauline: 'Not too bad, yeah'

Bob: 'Right, so I mean obviously if there's anything that comes up as you go along I've gotta be able to you know you and I, I'll just chat it through, but when it comes to things like er me talk to you, sales talk to you for instance about a comparative question, you wouldn't know what I was talking about would you?'

Pauline: 'No'

Bob: 'Cos I've never'

Bob: 'I've never covered things like comparative questions, when I talk to you about close and, you know basically what I'm talking to you about'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'cos you know roughly what close are about and you know how to close, but that, let's imagine for the sake of the discussion, that there's a hundred different ways of closing, right, and if there's a hundred different ways of close closing there's bound to be thousands of variations on each close, you see what I'm saying to you?'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'so there's a lot of scope, by, in other words, if you take a multiple, if you did, if you know four closes and you only use two, you might get away with it'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'if you know eight and you use four, again you're talking numbers see'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'everything basically comes down to numbers, er see, when I was talking to you earlier about about canvassing, right, I said basically you work on key words right now you don't need you, one, one of the things that I talked to you about canvassing is that if you notice the difference between a good canvass and a bad canvass, at least we didn't in fact activity sort of work to do in it, now if you take a, take a activ activity as being, being a key word and you discuss activity with them, right, you can then look at, at activity right as a variation on activity as there is on to action, right, now sit and do my script and talking to a customer, right, and mouthing and mouthing and mouthing and mouthing and saying your bit to a customer, you've got to sound like a parrot, now I know the way you canvass, the centre of action between you and the cu and the punter, do you see what I mean?'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'Right, now a lot of them don't interact with the customer, a lot of them don't even let the customer to think that the customer's not allowed to, they're frightened in case their customer opens their mouth and says no'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'right, this is exactly the same we're selling isn't it?
It's a case of interacting with a, with a'

Pauline: 'That's right, yeah'

Bob: 'Right, now if you don't interact right you're not gonna get a result and if the customer does not interact with you, then you're not gonna get a result, right, now if you assume that as you're working your way through that appointment that your enthusiasm is passing across to the customer or anybody else who is in the room, right, right, but through that interaction right you're working towards a result, now if you go and come out of that office, about his, with a result, you'll know you'll know what you're getting next week or next month you gotta I mean the customer's gotta be at the'

Pauline: 'well I know that, yeah'

Bob: 'there and then, now if we're talking about closing for a minute, right'

Bob: 'let me make you one up to objections, I'm not prepared to give you a decision tonight, what would you say to them on that?
Come on just go'

Bob: 'just to for a minute'

Pauline: 'I dunno you, yeah, you just sort of gotta say ob obviously you want to think about it, obviously it's, you know it's a lot of money, you know, but are you happy with the window, is it, you know, is it the sort of style of the win, you know, is it the sort of style of the window, we, we, I dunno, we agreed on this sort of style, is it the, you know, the sort of style that goes, goes with it, go through sort of one or two what and find out what, what it is they really want to think about'

Bob: 'Right, well let's just think for a minute exactly what you just said, can you repeat to me roughly what you've just said?'

Pauline: 'Yeah find out, I mean exactly sort of trying to find out exactly what it is that they want to think about, suggest, you know'

Bob: 'Mm'

Pauline: 'suggest that you've got another appointment in the area'

Bob: 'Mm'

Pauline: 'suggest that you'd like to think about it, suggest that you would pop back within an hour, two hours'

Bob: 'Right, but let's say that you're not prepared to pop back, let's say that you're sitting there and you've got from that point, you want, you no want to go to the house, right, now you're not you're not gonna treat as a twenty minute call back, let's kill that for a minute'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'right, now there is a precise and an exact way of working your way through it, right so maybe while use my words right, they might not be the same as yours but they will be roughly what you said a minute ago, right, what was your words, some of it?'

Pauline: 'Yeah, I've been trying to find out what'

Bob: 'Obviously obviously'

Pauline: 'yeah'

Bob: 'In other words you agree with the customer, right, now take my words, you wanna think it over, right, we're not prepared to give you a decision tonight, eh, now I'd say something like, well that's understandable, and we've gone through as many things and debt this evening as we probably need to go through, don't you agree?
Or words to that effect, right, and I realize that you have to think, think carefully in order to make the right choice, because it's gotta be right for you and it's also gotta be right for the property, alright?
But just er, you know, clarify my thinking on it, what exactly is it that you feel you want to think about?'

Pauline: 'The money'

Bob: 'Well, give me a bit of space for it'

Pauline: 'Mm, alright'

Bob: 'just exactly what it is you want to think about'

Pauline: 'mm, mm'

Bob: 'right, cos they'll not likely to say the money, they'll just sit and look at you, right, and anyway you wanna find out exactly what their problem is, so before they even get the chance to say the money, you say to them, just erm, you know, just er make it clear to me what is it that you want to think about, is it the design of the windows?
Is it the colour of the windows?
Is it the cost?
Is it this, is it that, is it the next thing and that's where you want to get them, cos they'll tell you what it is and you've got to, is it them, what is it?
Is it this, is it that, is it the next thing until they're prepared to tell you what it is, that's the way you ask them, cos they'll no volunteer what it is, cos what you're looking for is a final objection for them, right now you say oh that's a load of rubbish that does nay what, but how can you sit and study that and you learn how to use it customers, right, on the objection which is the hardest objection for any sales person to deal with, you know yourself'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'that is the hardest objection you can get, right, we're not prepared to give you the decision on the night, I wanna think it over, it's the same objection, right'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'well that's quite understandable and we're talking here about four thousand pounds, it's a lot of money to anybody isn't it?
Right, but we have covered most things that's ev, I don't know if I've actually missed anything out, right but just to clarify my thinking what is it you do actually want to think about, is it the the colour, is it what glass you want in the bathroom?
Is it the choice of handles?
Right, and you get them to something that you can deal with, because the one thing you cannot deal with right, we want to think it over, it isn't matter where you take them to, right whether it's the bathroom window, whether it's the one in'

Bob: 'do you see what I mean?'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'All you're doing is taking them from the objection, which is, well, we're not prepared to give a decision, take them from that objection to where you want them do it with me, can you do it?'

Pauline: 'Yes'

Bob: 'Go on, have a go alright, right I understand exactly what you're saying Pauline, right the only thing is the wife and I have thought about it and we're just not prepared to, you know what I mean, we're gonna have to take a couple of days, because we wanna think it over'

Pauline: 'Mm, yeah, I can't do it with you I'm sorry, I can't use it with you, I get the general, what you mean that is it, you know is it'

Pauline: 'with the style'

Bob: 'I got your stock see, I've got your stock, you're either gonna shut your case or you're going to the, you're going to go to the house or you're going have to move me from that objection that I've hit you with, then the objection that you're comfortable with, now that's what closes are about, it's dancing people from one objection to another, let me put you on another objection then, seeing as you're not too happy with that then'

Pauline: 'No I get, what I'

Bob: 'you understand the process?'

Pauline: 'Yeah, yeah'

Bob: 'Take people to objections, take them to where you want them to be and bear in mind you're always looking for an objection'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'right, another thing, we wanna get more quotes, right'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'you're the first person we've seen, right, how you gonna deal with that?'

Pauline: 'Well obviously want, you know, the best possible price and that, you know, want the best quality windows for us erm'

Bob: 'Yeah go on'

Pauline: 'if you haven't already shown them a window'

Bob: 'Alright'

Pauline: 'go on, you know go on and tell them the strengths of the window'

Bob: 'Alright, okay'

Pauline: 'and er obviously I want to sort of give you the best possible price'

Bob: 'Yeah'

Pauline: 'so, you, if you, we can even sort of go through your figures and hopefully make the price that we, you know, we show better or'

Bob: 'Yeah, I like that'

Pauline: 'and we er sort of use you know key members in the area that we've done work for'

Bob: 'Okay'

Pauline: 'erm and how we do compare to other companies erm'

Bob: 'Mm'

Pauline: 'I'm not very good at sitting doing this face to face but'

Bob: 'Right, but what I'm trying to say is that you can dance them to them and by the way when are you thinking of having it done'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'right cos then you're taking them away from the fact that you want other quotes right, they'll say to you oh we weren't thinking of doing it actually until the winter, right and then you can say to them well let me just say that by placing your order in now we can put your installation in hand, right, basically at today's prices, right, on an extended delivery, right, and you can still qualify for a special offer, right'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'and that means that we can sub you via sub'

Bob: 'measures than others in the area, right, and instal it before the weather gets too cold, and the price that's on the contract will be the total amount you have to pay or something like that'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'Right, now I'm trying to say to you is, that if, if you write, you write all these things down, you'll find that one thing won't react with another, you know we were talking about interacting'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'right, you'll gather a bit of string, I'm not saying you'll use the words I'm using, but the theme, do you see the theme that I'm talking about, about moving people and'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'dancing them a wee bit more, the more knowledge you've got'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'the more you can take them to where you want them, do you understand what I'm saying to you?'

Pauline: 'Yeah, I mean I, I did'

Bob: 'Er, you there's no offend that I can cover with you, I'm just having a wee chat with you on it in general terms on it, but I mean I could fill pages and pages'

Pauline: 'I'm not, I do it'

Bob: 'on bits and pieces'

Pauline: 'I mean I do it sort of a bit naturally, I mean if you, you know that what, the Delvine Hotel, I mean I sort of went in and I dunno sort of part way in I sort of said can I ask you if, you know, you've had your other quotes and he sort of said yes we're gonna sit down tonight and make our minds up'

Bob: 'That's right'

Pauline: 'er and I sort of, I thought well you know, I mean, I sort of went of that erm and I, I showed him a window, showed him a corner section erm, I didn't ask, I said I can't remember if your wife sort of erm, if your sister said it was the gold or the white handles'

Bob: 'Mm'

Pauline: 'er and obviously the bathroom and that I, I did it in me own sort of way'

Bob: 'That's right I know, but see this is, you see this is the point I'm trying to make to you, you can quite happily do it in your own way, but the problem is you don't know what you're doing, right, and, and if you actually knew what you were doing and well aware of what you're doing you would do it a hundred times better and you would do it all the time, right'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'I mean basically you say the bloke says we're going to sit down and make a decision tonight'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'you can accept that couldn't you?
Just the same as you can accept the fact that somebody says to you that I cannot really afford your windows, right, just the same as when you first speak to them on the phone, you can say oh sorry, sorry to bother you and put the phone down because it said you'

Bob: 'in the first place, but if that's his final objection, the fact that he's gonna make a decision tonight somebody that's really good at their job that was in there would sell that deal then, they wouldn't wait till tonight'

Pauline: 'That's what I did, didn't I?'

Bob: 'That's what I'm saying, right, now, what I'm saying is there's a, that, that, is, there's, there's, there's, there's things, there's things, there's guides to be able to do that, right, and the guide is there's certain things you do and certain things you don't do, because what you do basically is that you close him on his final objection which is what you're just saying you did, right, but you close him on his final objection, how did you manage to close him on his final objection?
Because you listened to what he was saying to you, now you might not believe it but the number of people that don't listen to what customers are saying to them, you follow me?
They're half listening and they're half thinking about what they're gonna say'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'and none of you are, don't know what I'm saying to you right'

Pauline: 'Yeah fair enough'

Bob: 'so you close him on his final objection, you listen, you then sell him his objection, right, you sell him his objection, right, you confirm his answer, right, whatever he says to you and his answer you actually confirm it back to him, you don't interrupt him, right, you don't guess where he's at, right and basically if work through a system you'll get on there, now for me to be able to, to, to, what I've just said to you is a load of garbage, but if I was sitting I was sitting actually go through each one of these steps and that's what you term as a closing sequence, you see what I mean?
There is a closing sequence now the reason that you were able to close in the manner that you did with that bloke is a natural ability, but if I've said to you to teach somebody else it you would say I cannot do it, but I can't teach somebody else, because you're not actually aware of the sequence that you're working, can you see what I'm saying to you?'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'Now that comes back to the question is, are salesman born or are they made?
Right were you born a sales person?'

Pauline: 'No, but I think you're moulded, but you have obviously'

Bob: 'That's right'

Pauline: 'intelligent a certain amount of intuition and [UNK]'

Bob: 'Aye, but you could of quite happily of gone through your life if you hadn't of seen that advert with the sell any'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'and had you of gone to the wrong company, right'

Pauline: 'I would of been put right off it straight away in my life'

Bob: 'That's right see we've talked, we've spoken about all the form closes before in the past, we've spoken about a sumter closes, I mean you know what I mean by a sumter close, don't you?
Whereby you're sitting with a customer and you've assumed that he's bought'

Pauline: 'Yeah, what I'm, what I'm a bit erm'

Bob: 'I mean I'm just having a general chat with you'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'and everything, cos some people I'm gonna have to go through the whole'

Pauline: 'What I feel like that'

Bob: 'lot one by one, mm'

Pauline: 'What I feel I do I do lack is I think I, I, I sort of communicate well with the, with the people, I think I cover the window and stones'

Bob: 'Right'

Pauline: 'I think I cover all that very well'

Bob: 'Right'

Pauline: 'but I'm, I'm a bit weak on'

Bob: 'What direction to go on, on their closes?'

Pauline: 'Yeah, I mean'

Bob: 'Alright let me ask you something then, off the top of your head how many closes could you put a name to?'

Pauline: 'Well I don't know you know what the name we've used'

Bob: 'Come on then how many, er just'

Pauline: 'I dunno there's sort of an order form for closing them'

Bob: 'You've got an order, try and, try and, what you should do is, you see some time we should sit and list them, right, you know you've got an order form closed'

Bob: 'call back, right, they're going to the toilet want it closed'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'right, what other closes can you think on?'

Pauline: 'Well I don't know the proper name for them, but I mean it's'

Bob: 'Well I'll tell you one or two then, right'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'you've got an order form closed, right you've got a sumter closed, where you assume that the customer's buying cos he's been giving you buying signals, you're hoping'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'he's been getting the buying signals right, you can close them on alternative choice, right, which do you prefer?
Right, do you prefer the slim line?
Do you prefer to put, do you, do you prefer the narrow gap or the wider gap?
Right and he says the wider gap, so you write it on the order form, right, it's part of the order form close'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'right, what vent depths do you want?
If we say, say twenty five percent, right mind you, you know these that most people have about a third to two thirds right'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'if he says a third, write it on the order form, do you see what I mean the order form closing?'

Pauline: 'Yeah probably laugh at me'

Bob: 'Pardon?'

Pauline: 'probably laugh a bit at that'

Bob: 'well I mean I'm only trying to get you to pick to pick it up one wee thing from every time I said, do have a chat with you, that's what we always say, I'm not expecting you to pick up anything else I've said to you tonight cos I'm only talking to you in general terms, but if you pick up one wee thing, right, story close'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'you can close on a story, now you're bound to tell stories Pauline'

Pauline: 'Yeah, ha, I, I, I do yeah'

Bob: 'I'm just trying to make you aware of what you're dealing when you're out there with the people's'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'You see what I'm saying to you?'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'Right'

Pauline: 'I mean I do that with a, you know when I'm sort of on about a long delivery talk about'

Bob: 'That's right'

Pauline: 'that you know he's a retired gentleman'

Bob: 'Alright'

Pauline: 'basically and they budget towards it'

Bob: 'I see'

Pauline: 'and that sort of thing'

Bob: 'Now I've not given you a lot of chance to speak because you said you don't want to go and to, but I want'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'to cover a wee bit of ground here, I'm just trying to make a point to you about how many closes you're probably not aware for the minute, these are only a few of them, right, similar situation close, right, lost sale close, right the didn't I cover that close'

Pauline: 'What do you mean by lost sale close?'

Bob: 'Well I'll be, I'm not going to go into it, that's a close on itself, just like the first one that I, everyone has got a sequence'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'you follow me?
But they're all, they're all a variation on a theme, but if you, you know what I mean, if you've got the closes in your head you can press buttons'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'you follow me, now when I say to you story book stay, eh er, I say your story close, right away you said I've done that'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'you know what I mean, if I say a similar situation close, right'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'you'll probably say well that is doesn't er quite ring a bell, because you've never used it and you cannot use it until I tell you what it is'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'do you see what I mean, right, sit and re-question close, right you can close them on ee do you want to include the extra window for two hundred pound, you follow me you've hit them with a price you want to close them, right and you sit and do the paperwork and you just say to them do you want me to include the extra window for two hundred pounds because you've already said to them you, you give an extra, do you follow me?
You've set them up'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'right with an extra window, whatever about the money, like Mrs what's her name, so you've nearly closed her on the conservatory you do all the paper, your order close form on the conservatory and you say to her, right, cos you're working your sums out, do you want me to include the extra window for two hundred pounds?'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'If she says yes, she's bought'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'do you see, do you understand the basis on what you're saying on that then?'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'These things we need to go in, right'

Pauline: 'I mean I did that, I mean it, it, er, er, at Exmouth when they all measured er, they had an extra window like and I sort of you know, do you want, you know'

Bob: 'If somebody says you don't wanna be rushed, right, that's what you've gotta say to them that's just what that old dear was saying the other day, right you certainly understand that, right, you agree with them, first thing you do you always agree with them, right and then you've just got the same sequence as I want to think about it, but just sort of make it clear, I mean what is it they actually, you know, frightened of being rushed into?'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'I mean when the order form is closing, you're closing things like, do you want white handles?
You follow me, ask them right then, I'm trying to get your head on er, on, on er how the form close see'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'without actually dealing with as and an order close, if I can I'll cover the multitude of things, right Now what would you say if somebody said I wanna look at aluminium windows'

Pauline: 'I want to what?'

Bob: 'I want to look at your aluminium windows, let's say we didn't do them right'

Pauline: 'Tell me what you would say'

Bob: 'I don't know, I'm not, my head's not on it, anyway that's the kind of things that'

Pauline: 'mm good, I mean that's not so appropriate these days life is it, cos P V C proved itself a bit more hasn't it?'

Bob: 'Aye, right I don't know if you if you feel that the wee chat we've had is any good but, because we don't want to chat along too long'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'but I'm trying to make you aware of the fact that at some stage we should be looking long and hard at closing, right we'd ask the questions, you're quite good at asking questions, some sale field don't ask question, don't ask questions, right see you want to have a'

Bob: 'as well when you're talking'

Bob: 'to say something they believe in, right do you like my window?
Yes do you follow me, was that sort of'

Bob: 'do you follow me?'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'The main questions you ask, the more he'll believe, he don't ask, it's, it's, it's all about, this is what I'm saying about erm reacting, eh when basically what you would is you'd make a statement, tell him something and then ask him a question, which is what you did anyway, but I don't know if you're always aware of what you're doing, you're doing, you do it naturally, selling is about making statements and then asking questions, you do it when you telephone customers all the time'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'right, but we've never covered all this see, you've picked bits up as you've gone along and another thing you should never give a choice of something and nothing you should always give a choice of something and something else'

Pauline: 'Oh yeah, but then you've also got to watch I mean that I'd, sometimes I'd muck things up when I've given too much choice I think'

Bob: 'Well that's like saying you want to lower your counters or shall we employ tall, tall girls'

Pauline: 'It's like what?'

Bob: 'saying shall we lower your counters'

Pauline: 'Or'

Bob: 'or shall we employ tall girls, you follow me?
What you say basically to somebody is, right, what do you want them this height or that height?'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'Do, do you follow in?'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'Do you know what I'm saying to you?
No'

Pauline: 'Ha'

Bob: 'Alright, let's, let's, I mean when you're, when you're'

Bob: 'a good choice for instance, right, all you say to somebody is do you prefer the traditional right or would you prefer the modern styles, right in other words would you like Georgian or would you rather have leaded'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'do you follow me?
That's an alternative choice, perhaps somebody says oh I preferred the leaded that's a buying signal'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'do you see what I mean, all these things, do you understand what I'm saying to you?'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'You've nearly of done it'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'you know what glass do you want?
You've, you've closed on, on patterns of glass'

Pauline: 'Yeah I do that a lot for the bathroom'

Bob: 'That's right so you can do it on leaded light, you can do it on handles, but either you lay it on the customer right, which do you prefer?
I've heard you saying it, which do you prefer, right, but you're aware of what you're doing'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'that's a closing question, which do you prefer?'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'Right now all these things which you've been saying are all written down'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'you follow me?
You're not the first person that have ever thought of it though, that's what I'm trying to say to you'

Pauline: 'You see I mean I can see the goal there every day, I can see, I can see me sort of getting to the goal, I just maybe sort of go around it, I mean well a bit I mean, since I've had these two I sort of said, you know, would it, would it be the white handle, let me show you, you know the gold handle and, you know'

Bob: 'Fine er what we're, what we're saying to you basically is, right, and, and another thing you're doing is proving that you're capable of doing it, now if I was training you from cold, right, and you hadn't done it'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'and I didn't know whether you were capable of doing it, I would make you, tell you had what to do'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'but because I know you can do it I can say you another one to one conversation with you about it, but basically you're no way near to guide the customer you're in there to sell the customer'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'right, and what you say is, as for the, you've got to stack you on er and when you're talking to them, right, you've got to use these words, that's what I was saying to you earlier, what do you prefer?
Which do you prefer?
How?
If?
How many?
Right who's usually be cleaning the windows, right, who would usually be cleaning the windows?
Right do you like?
Right, do you like net curtains behind your windows?
Do you like venetian blinds?
Are you following me?
You get, if you wanted to go in it really in depth'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'you can write down these words, that would then be given you a clue things that you could be saying to your customers, where, right, if you start thinking about the job that you're doing and I give you the word where, right you think of the number of times you can use the word where, with a customer, right'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'where would you put the'

Bob: 'right, where would you want to put the wooden fence?
Do you know what I mean?
Lead words, if you want to sit down and, in, in general you see er, you want to just sit down and think about what you're doing and what you're not doing, you can sit down and exercise on these words, now I'm not saying you'd ever want to do that, right now if, now you know I was saying to you about comparative questions right'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'was it comparative I was talking to you about?
I was talking about comparative, where some er situations and all this, that and the next thing, right, I mean one that, quite a, quite a useful phrase what you say is, isn't that true that, no you might not like that phrase, right, but you can take phrases like that and you can think to yourself can I, can I, right.
Tied in questions, they, they usually ask, you know I went on to you on, on about tied ins, right, didn't you, hasn't it, wouldn't you, right, wouldn't you prefer, wouldn't you rather, right, if you could wouldn't you.
Now these are all tied in lines'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'right, now if you want to understand how to tie down, you just need to look at one or two tied in lines, and then you can, you can add, oh you can add your main lines what I'm trying to say is, when it comes to, when it comes to, when it comes to, when it comes to selling, there's a lot more than just what might you've got, right, see I mean, I see for instance, you've probably, you probably don't, you probably don't, you probably don't go along right quite often right, people will buy what products can do with them, they don't buy the products, are you with me?
So you've gotta sell benefits you've gotta know what the product can do for them, right you've got to find out what they want from it I mean it might be security that's the big problem'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'you know that yourself, it might be maintenance'

Pauline: 'It might be condensation'

Bob: 'It might be condensation, right, now you're aware of these things, cos if you're really working professionally, your head's supposed to be running all across this stuff while you're in there, in there with the punters'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'you follow me?
If you're really into it, right, find out what your customer wants done always guard against talking too much'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'listen, right apath empathy is the word, you know what empathy is?
Relating, you form a, a bond basically between you and the customer, that's why you sell well, cos you gel well with your customers, there's empathy there, you've got to come across as caring and sharing, but you've gotta ask questions and you listen to the answers, right, you've got to basically treat their problems as if they were your own, do you know what I'm saying to you?
Right and you've got to sell benefits.
Let me give you an example of how you sell the benefits one and only one thing the handle, you've got that handle, that system'

Bob: 'you'll love that benefit'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'right, you love that benefit, doesn't matter about anybody else in the country likes that benefit, you are gonna sell them that benefit, but there's other benefits to the system, do you follow me?'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'You can actually get stronger as you go along on all the benefits so instead of selling one benefit, you could sell them a multitude of benefits because it means that if you're with a customer two hours or two and a half hours, instead of spending ninety percent of the time, chatting along, you, you'll not argue about, you follow me, I've stopped selling benefits, but I used to sell them brillian brilliantly, in other words you get, gives you a bit of meat'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'and you know how they say to you at times oh thanks ever so much, I've never heard anybody that would cover a thing in quite so much detail, I mean you don't want to sound like a machine that's pumping out information'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'but it's gotta be in your head, you know what I'm saying to you?
Because the more you know about your product, the more you know about the benefits, the more you know eh you've got to keep an open mind on it, you know that, right you cannot go out and just sell this ee for me, just one line, bom, bom, bom'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'bom, bom, right, cos I'm inclined to do that sometimes, right, you know you've got to sow seeds with customers that's where you get your recommends from, right, eh, you know that you put it, show a warmness towards you, you follow me?'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'You know, all these things again I'm working this all purely in key words, you follow me?
I put a word, because it, you follow me, it fits the theme that we're talking about, alright?
See basically if a customer objects, you're about to cover the, the fact that if the customer objects, say come back to canvassing for a minute, you get somebody, you phone somebody up and they say, urgh, urgh, and they just mumble away and they listen to you and they don't listen to you, right, it's a waste of bloody time, but if they talk to you and they give you objections and you deal with these objections, right, they're bound to buy'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'do you follow?
It's the people that, that actually, do you follow me?
What width do you use?
What's the distance between the two panes of glass, it's showing an interest doesn't it?'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'Right and you should never fight with objections, I think you realize that don't you?
Er if somebody hits you with an objection, you deal with it, you don't fight, you follow me?
You, you then take this and have a wrestling match with that objection you, you know what I'm saying?'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'You understand what I mean by that?
Eh you work it and you move on'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'you follow me?
You deal with it and you move, right'

Pauline: 'by the way'

Bob: 'there is a big bit out of it.'

Pauline: 'Mm'

Bob: 'Now a bad habit that I got into, right, a customer will be talking to me and I don't know if you've noticed it, I won't let them finish what they're saying, I'll jump in because I'll know what they're asking me'

Pauline: 'Yeah, I've noticed it a wee bit'

Bob: 'With me?
Right'

Pauline: 'A wee bit I mean'

Bob: 'Aye, but I mean I notice it, it's just that I've been doing that job that longly you see, you follow me?
Now you see, I'm anticipat'

Pauline: 'Yeah, anticipate'

## 041203

[UNK]: 'Are you with me?'

Pauline: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'Cos when you, when you get to the stage that you're at now basically, that it's not that difficult be what sort of extra money to find'

Pauline: 'No'

Bob: 'are you with me?
Now I don't wanna, want me to prattle on much more tonight, if it's not worth speaking about, I think it's probably about enough'

Tracey: 'But do you, oh'

Bob: 'What was you going say?'

Tracey: 'Without sort of looking for some, for a phrase or whatever, I'm more or less, I'm not too bad at erm, well'

Bob: 'Er I wonder if you will use any of the things that I've talked to you about tonight?
If only you were aware of we did the other things'

Tracey: 'Mm'

Bob: 'right I mean what would you for instance think if it's possible, if I can prove that right'

Tracey: 'Mm'

Bob: 'sixty percent of customers buy first through re recommendations, for instance, right, if I can prove to you that sixty percent of customers buy, buy first through recommendations, right, would you not see that as a kind er reason why you should buy first as well?
Right'

Tracey: 'Mm, but it's impossible to prove that is'

Bob: 'No it's not, I can sit there with a customer list and I could tell you who recommended who'

Tracey: 'Yeah, well you possibly can, I couldn't'

Bob: 'Try, I could, I would never say that to customers, that's a load of shit see, but the point is you, you'

Bob: 'you get some folk come away'

Tracey: 'Can you turn the T V down a fraction sweetheart?'

Bob: 'See basically what you're talking about is, you know when you close somebody, and I've got to come on to this, because this is the, this is the key to selling deals.
When you close you been hearing me say this to you when we first started, I'm sure that you, you know, you're aware of it now, you should be, what did I say to you once you've closed somebody?
Let's say you had somebody with a price'

Bob: 'now this should apply every time you hit somebody with a price, every time no matter where you are'

Tracey: 'Is the total amount payable?'

Bob: 'Alright, alright, the total amount payable, but there's only five thousand, six hundred and fifty four pound'

Tracey: 'That's the total price including VAT'

Bob: 'The total price including VAT, what do you say next?'

Tracey: 'price that goes onto it, on'

Bob: 'No you shouldn't say anything'

Tracey: 'Oh'

Bob: 'yeah and, and, open date it'

Tracey: 'Yeah I am aware of that style actually because I'd sent my brother a'

Bob: 'oh we've all got to be a little wary a wee bit'

Tracey: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'you should be wary of every appointment'

Tracey: 'Yeah, I do, I am actually, I mean, I'm not saying I'm a hundred percent'

Bob: 'Oh well you should be'

Tracey: 'but, yeah, well I am'

Bob: 'but I tell you if you ever get to the stage where you are, are a hundred percent that'll close deals, that's your best close of the lot'

Tracey: 'Mm'

Bob: 'really is, there is no beli, you've seen, you've seen it with me have'

Tracey: 'And you get, you get the object you get their objection then'

Bob: 'Oh, aye you'll get it'

Tracey: 'you know if you'

Bob: 'silence is the most powerful weapon you've got'

Tracey: 'Mm'

Bob: 'and verbal diarrhoea is the worse'

Tracey: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'that you can possible indulge in'

Tracey: 'I do do that because it gets a bit uncomfortable sometimes, you know'

Bob: 'You see, you know I was talking to you earlier about, about punchlines basically, but I can't remember the words I was using for it, times like by the way, right right, or did you know or did I mention to you do you follow me, a lot of key lines that you can think on that you use'

Tracey: 'Mm'

Bob: 'right, now if you can increase your number of closes that you know them and you're capable of using, and if you can increase your number of key lines that you, do you follow me'

Tracey: 'Mm'

Bob: 'in other words if you can improve your strength'

Tracey: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'what chance has the punters got?'

Tracey: 'Mm'

Bob: 'Right, cos, it's like everything, it's like your weight it either goes up and up and up or it goes down and down and down, you'll never hold it the same'

Tracey: 'Mm'

Bob: 'so if you try and work with the same amount of closes all the time, you'll end up getting weak in one or two'

Tracey: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'you know what I mean?
And you'll end up maybe only using one or two and you should be using ten, and you must go in a silence trap, that is so, so important'

Tracey: 'Mm you don't always use it though'

Bob: 'Used to though'

Tracey: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'last ones were a bit'

Bob: 'as it used to be, I mean I really, I get away with things, do you follow me?
But I don't wanna encourage you with it, do you follow me?'

Tracey: 'Yeah, I'm going upstairs'

Bob: 'Right I'm going through here some of these, some of these'

[UNK]: 'Mummy'

Tracey: 'Yeah, what?'

Bob: 'So you're thinking of washing her then are you?'

Tracey: 'it's only ten, in a minute for dinner'

Bob: 'Do you want a biscuit?

Tracey: 'Got up this morning she said can I have a pie?'

Tracey: 'She's had a big cake'

Bob: 'it's only a plain one'

Tracey: 'No they didn't, well neither don't think, either they sort of much'

Bob: 'Mm, real'

Tracey: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'mm so he'll have got a settlement as well then won't he?'

Bob: 'There would be a trust or something probably set up for him that's the normal'

Tracey: 'Yeah when he's eighteen but the trouble is I don't know what's happened I've lost, I suppose mum'll have to do it because erm Tom has sort of cut him out, or said he was going to cut him out, but I think'

Bob: 'But in any divorce settlement I know with myself'

Tracey: 'Get off you don't climb on people's chairs you sit on them or you play on the floor'

Bob: 'but, if there's, if there's erm, if there's set if there's a settlement like that there'd been settled so much on her'

Tracey: 'Yeah'

Bob: 'and they would also, they, she probably the, the lawyers would also go for a settlement for him the property'

Tracey: 'I would think a lot of the money is actually in property already or she's got to have it in property'

Bob: 'Mm, mm'

Tracey: 'because erm, I know he had a lot, he'd like try to buy everything in property so that he didn't actually have a lot of cash'

Bob: 'Mm, mm'

Tracey: 'so I don't know how that works'

Bob: 'Er it was split back'

Tracey: 'Yeah'
