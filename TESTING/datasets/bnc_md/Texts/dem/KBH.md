Adam: 'The two companies concerned are trying to record the spoken word.'

Carole: 'We don't want you on tape.'

Adam: 'So the thing, the thing to do is to sort of dot around in the conversation things like pre antidisestablishmentarianism.
And hopefully'

Carole: 'This will get modern usage of words.
Of, one of the words that she was talking about, people have started using wicked for [UNK] a normal phrase.
I mean, it doesn't mean what it says in the dictionary any more.'

Pauline: 'That's a really wicked thing to say, he went, no it's not it's bad, it's not wicked.
He thinks of wicked as being good, he doesn't, cause Mandy says wicked.'

Carole: 'Yeah.
Well that's the idea anyway.'

Pauline: 'He goes round saying wicked, it's his favourite word.'

Carole: 'Are you going to go to sleep, eh?
Please That doesn't mean much, does it?'

Adam: 'She's just looking over there to see which one she wants to throw up on.'

Carole: 'Who do you want to go and gurgle at?
Eh?'

Pauline: 'Oh not Uncle Brian, no no no.'

Carole: 'No?
Have you had enough grub for a little while?
There you are, go and see somebody.'

Pauline: '[UNK] she's got a ginormous one.
She had it [UNK].
Well don't [UNK] to me I've only just you'

Adam: 'Come on, give Auntie Pauline a nice smile.'

Carole: 'Go on, you do lovely smiles.'

Carole: 'If she smiles it will be at your hairline.
Pardon?'

[UNK]: 'She won't be able to see that far, will she?'

Carole: 'She might be able to see a blurred shape.'

Pauline: '[UNK] she's just looked this way now.
She kept looking over there.
Don't know what she was looking at.
What were you looking at?'

Carole: 'Well she definitely looks at her mobile.'

Adam: 'Yeah?'

Carole: 'I know it drives you mad, the music but er'

Adam: 'I wouldn't mind if those blasted [UNK] slightly longer life in terms of the music they played.
But unfortunately, you know, it's or whatever.
But it's [UNK] over again.'

Carole: 'Well, yes.
Well I mean that's what's nice for them, isn't it?'

Pauline: 'Yeah.
You see they've got a short concentration.'

Adam: 'Do you think [UNK] music in the background [UNK] sort of, do all the lyrics as well.'

Carole: 'Oh of course Oh well done.
[UNK] the last half hour.'

Pauline: '[UNK] a little bit wasn't it?'

Carole: 'She's had a lot of that today.'

Pauline: 'Have you?'

Carole: 'Well don't put it on too loud, will you?'

Pauline: '[UNK] why babies have a suck there.
You say they're having milk, he went, what do you mean?
Milk?
What do you mean milk comes out there?
So I said well it's only when you've just had a baby like, you know, like cows.'

Carole: 'Love him.'

## 003902

Then he's got to go home at lunchtime and give her some food.'

Oh, you're doing it in English are you?
I hate this in English.
This, this video.
Oh it's the voices I can't stand.'

Charlotte: 'Bonk.'

Carole: 'Did it go bonk?
Listen, go away She doesn't say go away very much now.'

Charlotte: 'Go away.'

Carole: 'Does she?
Well she's just heard it, that's why, but she doesn't she doesn't say it very much does she?
No?
I've only heard it once or twice in the last few'

Joelle: 'When I change her nappy?'

Carole: 'Well, that's normal.
She doesn't want you to change her nappy does she?
Water please.
Right, let's go and see if these chicken things are ready.
Right, right, would you like to sort of start getting yourselves into the other room.
Now the baby's waking up, dinner's ready.'

Adam: 'Is baby waking up?'

Carole: 'She keeps kicking her legs and going, ah, ah.'

Adam: 'Is the [UNK] ready [UNK]?'

Carole: 'No, it's not.
I said try and start thinking about getting in there because'

Adam: 'How soon?'

Carole: 'About two minutes.'

Adam: 'Shall we start [UNK]?'

Carole: 'After dinner, yeah.'

Adam: 'Yeah.
[UNK] Brian and Pauline probably won't arrive till it's virtually over.'

Carole: 'Probably not.
Do you think Charlotte will eat a turkey steak with garlic and herbs?
What?
I said do you think Charlotte will eat a turkey steak with garlic and herbs?'

Adam: 'We'll see, won't we.'

Carole: 'You hungry?
Miss?
What's happening, water please, water, water.
Ah, that's that done.'

Adam: 'Oh, it smells good.'

Carole: 'They do don't they?
I thought we'd try them for a change.'

Adam: 'They look really nice.'

Carole: 'Like chicken Kiev without a load of sloppy butter.
Bit smaller than normal ones.
There's a lot of banging and crashing on this tape.
What else do I need?
A plate for Charlotte.
Brian said, we'll make it tomorrow night, eight to eight thirty.
So, cos he had an early, erm, what do you call it, early estimate.'

Adam: 'Oh Charlotte, look what [UNK].'

Carole: 'Don't be naughty.'

Adam: 'Can you sort erm, madame out?'

Carole: 'Off you go Jess, go and be fed.
Is that nice?
Is that a nice cake?'

Charlotte: 'Mm.'

Carole: 'Mm.'

Carole: 'Pardon?

Joelle: 'It's Charlotte choosing.'

Carole: 'Pardon?'

Joelle: 'It's Charlotte choosing.'

Carole: 'Chose what?'

Joelle: 'The cake!'

Carole: 'Oh, right.
Did you know what you were choosing?
Did you walk around Tesco's?
Did you walk, or did you sit in your pushchair?'

Joelle: 'Tell the truth.
Did you walk, or did you walk in your pushchair?'

Adam: 'Sit in the pushchair.'

Carole: 'Yeah, one of these things you sit in, put twenty P in or whatever it is, and have a ride for two minutes.'

Joelle: 'So she said, mm.

So I said, if you are a good girl you can choose a cake.
So went to Tesco, and we walk around, the cake, erm, cake thing'

Carole: 'Aisle?'

Joelle: 'and er, I said [UNK]'

Carole: 'Oh Charlotte, don't talk with your mouth full. [UNK]'

Joelle: 'We went to Tesco to buy some milk.'

Adam: 'To buy some milk?'

Carole: 'Because Sainsbury didn't have any yesterday.'

Adam: 'Did they have any today?'

Carole: 'I don't know, I didn't go today.
What did I do today?
[UNK] I made beans, when I'd finished sorting out this one I [UNK].

Carole: 'You're not tired.'

Joelle: 'Why not?'

Carole: 'You shouldn't be tired.'

Charlotte: 'I'm happy.'

Carole: 'Oh I'm so glad you're happy.
She's a poor old lady at the moment.'

Adam: 'Is she?'

Carole: 'Poor old lady.
Charlotte please don't talk with your mouth full, there's a good girl.'

Adam: 'Keep your mouth closed when you've got something in it or we'll take something away.'

Carole: 'It's not, it's not very nice darling, to do that.'

Adam: 'It's not good manners.
We want to bring up a nice girl, not a little pig.
Alright?'

Charlotte: '[UNK] pig.'

Adam: 'No, nice girl, not a little pig.'

Charlotte: '[UNK] pig.'

Adam: 'Yes, nice girl.
Are you a nice girl?'

Charlotte: 'What?'

Adam: 'Not the way you stuff your cake in your mouth like that.'

Carole: 'Dear oh dear.
I wouldn't bounce at the same time [UNK]'

Adam: 'Don't bounce when you're eating please.
And shut your mouth.
Good girl.'

Charlotte: '[UNK] trampoline now.'

Carole: 'You're going on the trampoline.
Well finish your mouthful first, please.'

Joelle: 'Or [UNK]'

Carole: 'Ah that wasn't her fault.
Have you finished?
Have you finished eating?'

Charlotte: 'No.'

Carole: 'No?
No'

Joelle: '[UNK] calls for you.'

Joelle: 'Swansea.'

Adam: 'Right hand side.'

Carole: 'Oh right.
I couldn't work out what you were talking about.
It only takes one at a time.'

Adam: 'No it's not [UNK] now.'

Carole: 'It's bath time really.'

Adam: 'Be bath time in about fifteen minutes.'

Carole: 'I thought you'd finished your cake, haven't you finished?'

Joelle: 'Catch it, one two three catch it, one two three.
I said catch it, you didn't catch it, [UNK].'

Carole: 'What?'

Joelle: 'It's Top Of The Pops.'

Carole: 'Top Of The Pops, oh'

## 003903

Carole: 'I haven't watched Top of the Pops.
[UNK] will sit there cringing, said I can't believe they put this rubbish on [UNK] terrible.'

Pauline: 'Who was on it?'

Carole: 'Don't know who was on it actually.
Well she doesn't like M C Hammer, he was on, and then there was one week with Germans on it and it was, erm, it's a German group that used to be popular and haven't done a song for ages.'

Charlotte: 'It wasn't the Robots was it?'

Carole: 'Yeah, the Robots.
I mean, it was just the words they were using, I mean oh It makes you cringe, oh and then that er girl oh she's done quite a few things recently.
She sings much better than she talks.'

Pauline: '[UNK] back to my diet today.
Thank you very much, yes I will actually.'

Carole: 'No, it's not my day to diet, been, been naughty today.
[UNK] Oh dear.'

Adam: 'Pop him on the shoulder.
. So did you enjoy Paul Simon?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

## 003904

Adam: 'She was about to but she found a sticker on book [UNK]'

Pauline: 'She comes out well on tape doesn't she?'

Carole: 'Who Charlotte?'

Pauline: 'Mm.
I didn't realise how clear her speech was until I heard it on the tape.
It's really quite good actually.'

Adam: 'Not bad.'

Pauline: 'Oh we'll do this one again.'

Charlotte: '[UNK] drop off'

Adam: 'Cos it's lights and things isn't it?
She was looking at er lights in Sainsbury's the other day.
It looked like that, didn't it?'

Adam: 'Carol was swaying at her.'

Carole: 'You missed that.
I just swayed at her, and she [UNK]'

Charlotte: 'It's Conway Twitty isn't it?'

Adam: 'Is it?
Oh no.
How far back does this go, I suppose early fifties?'

Adam: 'Er nineteen fifty six.
I remember Conway Twitty.'

Carole: 'Oh yes.
You were in your cradle.
[UNK] Elvis, didn't he?'

Adam: 'I don't think he ever recorded it, I think he just used to sing it at his, er sort of cabaret.'

Carole: 'Well so many of these songs have been done by so many people that you would be forgiven for thinking that, that.
Because there's one there, one on one of these that er either Paul Simon or Art Garfunkel or someone, can't remember which one, probably Art Garfunkel as Paul Simon does all his own doesn't he?'

Adam: 'Well he has done other people's.'

Carole: 'Well there's one on there, I can't remember'

Adam: 'Like for instance the, er, what do they call those two?
Oh the two brothers.
In the'

Carole: 'Everley Brothers?'

Adam: 'The Everley Brothers, that's it.
You know, Wake up Little Suzie?'

Carole: 'Oh yeah.'

Adam: 'Well Simon and Garfunkel did that [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Wicked far out.
it's a groovy record this.'

Carole: 'Shut up. [UNK]'

Pauline: 'Can't remember which one it is but I'll recognise it when I hear it.'

Adam: 'He's doing very well, isn't he.'

Carole: 'He is.
Have to employ him full time.
He's always quite good.'

Pauline: 'I just can't believe how daft he is.'

Carole: 'I suppose you like that film. [UNK]'

Pauline: 'Yes. [UNK]'

Adam: 'Forget it.'

Carole: 'You're not having cake.'

Pauline: 'Does she like cake?'

Carole: 'Well she's looking at it.'

Adam: 'So how's things down at the [UNK]?'

Pauline: 'Not too bad.
Quite good actually. [UNK]'

Adam: 'Yeah?'

Carole: 'Keeping him busy out on estimates and'

Pauline: 'Yeah he's out all this week.
Well, my dad won't pass them on to Terry.
Me dad said he's had enough [UNK] Well, we were debating whether to give it to you or not.
But I thought, well if Terry notices he might [UNK].
Well in fact two really big estimates [UNK]'

Adam: 'Who, Terry?'

Pauline: 'Yeah.
And one wanted re-estimating, the other one wanted a few more prices cos everything like marble tops which are going to cost a fortune to get done.
We give them a provisional kind of price and not really gone into it in detail.
So she had a list of about five things she wanted sorted out and she said so far we were the cheapest.
But she's got about six different firms on the computer and was comparing notes.
So I worked out [UNK] and the other two were really fitting and electrics and it was all down to Terry to sort those out.
And they're both, about two to three thousand pounds worth of sanitary ware or more but two to three thousand pounds worth of work.'

Adam: 'Well you can't afford to lose them, can you?'

Pauline: 'No.'

Adam: 'So what's going to happen then?'

Pauline: 'God knows.
He said, I asked, asked, well I left a message on Saturday for him to sort them out didn't I?
He already knew about that.
And then I asked my father on Tuesday to remind him and he said, he'd already said he'd fetch them in on Tuesday.
And he, my father reminded him last night and he said yeah he would have them by tomorrow morning.
But he's [UNK], he just really has to get in touch with one of them [UNK] and tell them the prices.
So I don't know.
[UNK] Well, I mean he'd done, he's done this first estimate, these are all just polishing touches cos people are obviously interested in, you know they're well keen on our prices.'

[UNK]: '[UNK] they can't pursue it till we come back to them.'

Pauline: 'They're not pursuing it until we put these things out.
[UNK] My father just turned round [UNK] I've had enough of it if Terry's not going to do the estimate he passes them on to Brian.
I said yeah then I get into trouble with them for not passing estimates to Terry and then there's an argument.
If he, if he says anything to me I'll just have to tell him.
But he's not doing the estimates he's been given and he can't afford to throw money away.
It's cos he's working for him at the moment [UNK] money.
He always gets like that and then he forgets after like a month or two when he hasn't worked for him.
He forgets how annoying he can be and you know he swings the other way.
I mean Brian's pulled in a lot of work.
[UNK] lot of people kind of saying come back again on Thursday So he's, he's [UNK].
If we got Terry to do that we'd be well away.
They, they would love him I mean one of them it was annoying really cos Terry's just not pulling his weight.'

[UNK]: 'I don't understand it, if I live to be a hundred I won't understand it.'

Pauline: 'And also, it's cos that, you know after we had that row about Terry, after Bank Holiday expecting not to have to do a day in the shop, and er he's already owing Brian a day?
Guess who's doing the extra day? [UNK] got my dad to cover a day.
And then he takes a day off Bank Holidays.
[UNK] and he can't do it because my dad [UNK].
But then tomorrow he's actually doing his own work.
So he could easily have [UNK].
And on Monday'

Adam: 'So who's covering tomorrow?'

Pauline: 'Well my brother's covered practically all week and Brian's doing tomorrow.
[UNK] Terry phoned up asking what, Tuesday morning about quarter past eight said who was covering.
And he said well my father is doing today I can't do today I'll do it Friday and I shouted down the stairs but he owes you a day you shouldn't be going in.
I mean he hasn't been in the shop once this week.
Somebody's got to tell him to [UNK] [UNK]'

Adam: 'So do Dave and Terry [UNK] in the shop [UNK].'

[UNK]: 'They have the records. [UNK]'

Adam: 'And it hasn't been sorted yet?'

Pauline: 'Oh no.
He's got the gall to phone up on Tuesday and say Eileen can't do a day, we're going to be short of Eileen.'

Adam: 'So the answer is to just phone them.'

Pauline: 'I can't do it.'

[UNK]: 'I'm not doing it. [UNK]'

Adam: 'What's the point of carrying on like that?'

Pauline: 'Well he's going to carry on like that isn't he?
Not unless someone puts their foot down.'

Adam: 'And if your father is currently taking your side of things worth sounding him out as to how far he'll take [UNK]'

Pauline: 'Ah [UNK]'

Adam: 'whilst he's in the mood?'

Pauline: 'Yeah.
He's not being that much [UNK]'

Adam: 'You sure?'

Pauline: 'Mmm.
He's probably only in the mood cos he's probably upsetting them on his night out cos they go out in the evenings.
On a Wednesday evening, don't they.
Cos Terry'

Adam: 'I mean, wouldn't he rather have Terry as a sort of permanent worker anyway?'

Pauline: 'It's not being fair [UNK]'

[UNK]: '[UNK] do any work.'

Adam: 'Oh what, your dad?'

[UNK]: 'Pauline's dad [UNK] er [UNK]'

Pauline: '[UNK] too expensive I think.
Terry uses the shop to get extra money every so often, uses my dad [UNK] ticking over running when he [UNK]'

Carole: 'Why [UNK].
He does get the offer, I mean [UNK]'

Pauline: '[UNK] two months and she phoned up and I kind of made out it got lost in the post.
I erm got, check you've got two days, you've got give me the estimate, it's got to be on because she's expecting it to be done straight away on the computer and sent.
And he actually got that one done.
Do you know it was only five lines.
I mean I could have made it up it was that easy.
So I sent that off.
She was in first thing, I mean I sent it off that evening she was in first thing the next morning yes that's fine [UNK].
So he's got that job and another one [UNK].'

Carole: 'She's trying isn't she?'

Adam: 'I don't understand why it surprises you, that's what gets me.
I mean [UNK]'

Carole: 'It's normal behaviour [UNK].
Charlotte's done it too.'

Adam: 'Can you pass me that er, sheet?'

Carole: 'This?'

Pauline: 'Is that your reading?
That's not your regulations you have to read is it?'

Carole: 'Oh no, that's a [UNK]'

Pauline: 'I was going to say that doesn't seem very thick [UNK]'

Carole: 'No, that's to do with this tape.'

Adam: 'Oh I tell you what is quite funny these, the act.'

Carole: 'Mmm.'

Adam: 'Oh.
[UNK] hereby enacted her gracious majesty, you know, etcetera etcetera.
What was it, the Lords temporal and spiritual, that's what they call themselves.'

Pauline: 'Now that is, that's [UNK]'

Adam: 'Yes.
Yeah I realise and I hope I don't come into contact with too many acts of parliament.'

Pauline: 'Oh, we had someone round to see the house yesterday.'

Carole: 'Oh yeah?'

Pauline: 'They came twenty minutes early, there's Brian up in the shower, there's me stuffing things in the cupboard under the stairs.'

Carole: 'That's an old trick.'

Pauline: 'I said to Danny, don't open the door.
Don't open the door!
So as I'm still trying to stuff things away, she opened the door and everything fell out.
[UNK] look round the front room, then they looked round the, the garden.
While they were looking round the garden I [UNK] you've got to get out the shower quick.'

Pauline: 'I don't know.
They'd come down from, they'd come down from, erm, somewhere or other.
They're just doing a kind of tour of loads and loads of houses cos they keep moving with his job.'

Carole: 'Oh, right.'

Pauline: 'She quite, I think she liked the area, she was saying about the schools and that.
Mind you, she likes erm [UNK] and they're all separate, all the best ones round here are [UNK].
She said don't they have any details?
So I said well, no it's not [UNK] now is it, it's erm, oh it's that school that the [UNK].
Something and School of Arts now it's called [UNK] well technical'

Adam: 'School of Arts round here?'

Pauline: 'No it's another, well technical, [UNK]'

Carole: '[UNK] performing arts here.'

Pauline: '[UNK] performing arts and that's the technical'

Carole: 'It's a monstrosity.'

Pauline: 'Oh you rotten old pig, you've been sick.'

Carole: 'Oh she hasn't?
Oh.'

Pauline: 'Yeah, it's alright.'

Carole: '[UNK] is it washable?'

Pauline: 'Yeah, I think so.'

Adam: 'You'll soon find out. [UNK]'

Carole: 'Yes.
Do you feel better now?
Obviously.'

Pauline: '[UNK] I think she thinks she's got some milk now.'

## 003905

Pauline: 'I thought you said, one, you had to have somebody involved who is?.'

[UNK]: 'No no no one person that's not right.'

Pauline: 'Oh, right.'

[UNK]: 'There is no, statutory obligation for the person organizing it'

Adam: 'Oh, I know.'

Pauline: 'Well not the organizer surely oh I know I would have thought you'd have to, [UNK] shoot it'

[UNK]: 'I'm sure that the social services require psychiatric or'

Pauline: 'Mm, I would of thought so'

[UNK]: 'obviously medical [UNK] what you're doing.
Mhm but they're to be qualified people involved.
But I would have expected that the whole thing would have to be operated by, somebody who was qualified.'

Pauline: 'I don't know, because like, you know like the doctors [UNK]'

[UNK]: '[UNK] I think it sort of depends how big that you want to get involved in.
If you're just somebody who's on the outside providing services, to keep the smooth running of it then you don't really have to know anything about it.'

Adam: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'But if you're actually involved in it, and you want to be involved in the people, then I think you have to know something about it.'

Pauline: 'Well the other evening they were showing something on T V, one of these doctors', doctors' practices that are opting out or whatever.
And they got a stockbroker, someone who used to be a stockbroker, actually managing the whole practice.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Pauline: 'I mean he's obviously not qualified as a doctor.'

[UNK]: 'Mhm.'

Pauline: 'So I mean I suppose they'll look at it in the same kind of way, somebody who's got managerial, management qualities rather than I suppose people who are interested in the other side of it, the medical side of it, probably, really be geared up to organizing the money side of it wouldn't they, usually one or the other.'

Adam: 'So have you done any more calculations on it?'

[UNK]: 'There's nothing really more [UNK] I mean the whole thing is a budget guesstimate.
I've no idea yet, really what, I mean, you know, for instance I don't know how much ratio staff to patients they need, therefore you can't really, you know, follow that up because you've no idea what the costs themselves could be.'

Carole: 'Well you don't know, have you, have you found the statutory requirement for space yet?
Per person.'

[UNK]: 'I think the thing is going to come unstuck in the, I think the biggest thing is, I was thinking, is the fact that you've got to get [UNK] I wouldn't get a commitment from Social Services until they see a property actually ready for occupation.
Now I'm not gonna be prepared to go through the whole business and then find them say oh sorry you're wrong.'

Adam: 'Property is the biggest bugbear.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.
Because I don't think'

Adam: 'If you're actually sitting on [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'I don't think the banks are gonna want to invest.
To be perfectly frank.
You see the only way we can get equity out and put money in ourselves is by selling this place.'

Adam: 'Yes.'

Carole: 'Therefore if we don't actually want to live in the same place as the residents, which I certainly wouldn't want to do, right.
We'd have to buy two [UNK] adjoining.
Yeah.
So that either means [UNK] providing it, or something further down the scale [UNK].
I mean that's, huge.
That to be honest is, is somebody who's like, been doing this for ten years and has already got themselves like half a million pounds of worth of equity.
You know it's a huge property.'

Pauline: 'But you would need a large property to do what you want?'

[UNK]: 'I don't think so.'

## 003906

Adam: 'It would be eleven bedrooms and five receptions [UNK].
The point is, that you've got to count, if [UNK], you've got to count one bedroom [UNK]'

Carole: 'Yes, I've got [UNK]'

Adam: 'you count one bedroom for all the [UNK].
You may even have to count two.
You certainly got to count one.
So two bedrooms out of twelve are no longer available.'

Carole: 'Sorry?
Say that again in English.'

Carole: 'They're coming to collect the stuff next Thursday.
But I don't have to do it every day all day.
It's twenty tapes.
So that's twenty times ninety minutes.
[UNK] talking about his [UNK] estimates.
Very exciting stuff and I've been telling her not to speak so loudly.
Have you had enough now?'

Adam: 'and then I'm talking about [UNK] right?
It's gonna cost five and a half thousand [UNK] mortgage.
At this point [UNK] would cost about just, just about half.'

[UNK]: 'Six bedrooms would pro, six bedrooms would probably cost you two [UNK] to buy.
[UNK] five and six bedroom houses and you won't get anything under two hundred thousand pounds.'

Adam: 'How much do you wanna to bet on that?'

Adam: 'Mm?'

[UNK]: 'Where?'

Adam: 'I've been waiting for [UNK] on one.'

[UNK]: 'Where?'

[UNK]: 'You've got to spend as much or twice as much there as you would there as you would anywhere else.
Those other properties, there isn't half the amount of work need doing there as [UNK].
[UNK] needs a lot of work.
If we moved in then we'd have to spend fifty thousand pound to get it up to scratch.
That's just to live in.'

Adam: 'Alright, O K, let's say two hundred grand, O K?
It's still fifty per cent less than one of those properties at Harrow Road, right?
Fifty per cent less on the mortgage means erm about three and a half thousand [UNK].
It's effectively eighteen thousand per annum saved, right?
The cost of and [UNK] gain four bedrooms [UNK]'

[UNK]: '[UNK] the cheaper it should become.'

Adam: 'Oh yes it is, I don't doubt it but the problem is [UNK] right?
And you've got to be realistic.
Because no bank is going to give you the money against the costs of the value of the property right?
They're gonna give you the [UNK] against equity [UNK] equity of some sort.
But the only way you can get the equity, right?
The only way we could get the equity.
We could do it.
[UNK] The only thing I could do [UNK] I mean at the same time I'm saying O K I'll go in to do it this way, would be to actually say, sod this for a lark, instead of doing erm totally private thing, gonna set up a private limited company [UNK] to issue [UNK] cheques.'

Joelle: 'I really couldn't I would never get the price I'd want for the alphabet.'

Adam: 'Shall we go for a stroll?'

Pauline: 'No [UNK].'

Adam: 'Fetch the [UNK]'

Pauline: 'No, no, no, no, no.'

Adam: 'What do you mean, no?'

Pauline: 'You've got to take the [UNK] with you.'

Adam: 'Why?'

Carole: 'Why are you [UNK].
Why are you going for a walk?'

Adam: 'To go and see [UNK] What have you bought?
Oh you're not starting again, are you?'

Pauline: 'Yeah, you're not to smoke any more.'

Adam: 'I haven't got any.'

Pauline: 'You are not to smoke [UNK]'

Carole: 'You're looking so guilty.
The pair of them.
Really.'

Adam: 'Excuse me, excuse me ladies.'

Carole: 'Since when do you ask Brian if he wants to go for a walk?'

Adam: 'This is nothing to do [UNK]'

Pauline: 'Empty your pockets.
Come on.'

Adam: 'This is [UNK] going down on the table.'

Pauline: 'Come on, you're not going to have them in there, are you?
I'm not daft.'

Adam: 'Alright?'

Pauline: 'I wasn't born yesterday.
You might forget them one day and they'll get washed.'

Adam: 'That is not for me to contribute to.'

Carole: '[UNK] I haven't said anything about it.
Amy [UNK].
Let go of my neck.
She's a major contributor to these tapes, aren't you?'

Pauline: 'Shall we take her for a walk?'

Carole: 'You really must think we're daft.
He's sleeping down here tonight.
It's bad enough being woken up by the baby without going back to bed and then being woken up by [UNK].'

Pauline: 'I've been going to bed at half past one and I was doing the T M A for two nights, then I've been doing his V A T for two nights so I've got to bed really really late and I just and, the thing is, the T M A were all on about my [UNK] then I just start to relax [UNK] I had to resort to herbal knockout drops.'

Carole: 'Oh that's very naughty.'

Pauline: 'Right.
Definitely smoking [UNK].
Well, we were sitting there doing the V A T and I thought, I don't know that's just not [UNK] but'

Charlotte: 'How much is it when you want to go cinema?'

Pauline: 'Oh, [UNK] about two seventy five I think but I'm not sure'

Carole: 'Is it as little as that?'

Pauline: 'it might be more but [UNK].
Well I'd either do it that way or pay, erm, credit cards.
I don't really take any notice.
Terrible'

Carole: 'Naughty, isn't it?'

Pauline: 'I don't think it's terrible [UNK]'

Carole: 'White Fang.'

Pauline: 'Oh what on earth's that?'

Carole: 'It's the latest Disney extravaganza, and a wolf cub in it, oh Kirsty [UNK] loves [UNK].'

Carole: 'Oh isn't it?'

Charlotte: 'No, it says here, the story of a young wolf.'

Carole: 'Oh, she'll probably like that [UNK]'

Charlotte: '[UNK] tomorrow we'll go somewhere and spend my money. [UNK]'

Carole: 'Yes I suppose by the time she's here [UNK] look different.'

Pauline: 'Gonna have your hair done? [UNK] a perm.'

Carole: 'She hasn't got enough to have a perm, has she now?'

Pauline: '[UNK] I think she's gonna grow it out.
She's gonna, perm the top so she can grow it out.
I told you, didn't I say, as soon as she gets it cut she'll be growing it out.
[UNK] Where are you going to get it done?'

Charlotte: 'Er in [UNK]'

Pauline: '[UNK] they normally cut it well.
Bit expensive though.'

Carole: 'Twenty one pounds forty five.'

Pauline: 'Just to have it cut and blow dried?'

Carole: 'Regardless of whether it's a restyle or trim.'

Pauline: 'Bit expensive.'

Carole: 'That is.'

Pauline: 'Mind you, my hair was a lot better when I was having it done [UNK].'

Carole: 'I must admit though it looked lovely, I'll say that.'

Pauline: 'I only had a trim, but the blow dry made it sort of Do you remember when I got that, my hair cut really short?
They did that, and that was, that was really nice.
When I look back at the photographs I think And even when it was long I had, there was one hairdresser there called Paul, whom I'd go and see regularly [UNK].
I'd go and see him regularly because he did it really well, once he left'

Carole: 'Well I had one like that, you know when we used to go to that gym up in Chelsea?'

Pauline: 'Mind you my regular's back and she charges three pounds.'

Carole: '[UNK] six weeks.'

Pauline: '[UNK] I haven't been since, what [UNK] isn't it?
[UNK] Trouble is now, cos I know a hairdresser [UNK] the shop, if I go somewhere else, it looks a bit you know and yet I'm not very satisfied with the way he cuts it, he's done it cheap.
Mind you, he did Mandy's [UNK] at Mandy's, I thought that was quite nice.
[UNK] Have you got a hiccup?'

Carole: 'Caught it off Amy.'

Pauline: 'She's gone to sleep now?'

Carole: 'They are aren't they?
But he phoned up to order it and said oh my wife likes these soppy things, he bought it, I didn't.
It had nothing to do with me.
Then he wants me to tape it so he can have it in the car cos it's on C D.'

Pauline: 'Hold your breath.
[UNK] drink some water, concentrate [UNK]'

Carole: 'Well, if you want to get rid of hiccups, drink'

Pauline: 'Hold your breath and [UNK] push [UNK] seems to work on me.'

Carole: '[UNK] stand on your head.
Run round the block or something.'

Charlotte: 'Why can I, er I can't have hiccup?'

Carole: 'Because you don't like them.
You keep complaining every time you get hiccups, you say oh I don't like them.
I'm trying to help get rid of them, sorry.'

Pauline: 'Supposed to work isn't it?'

Carole: 'Once she's gone, once she's gone she's gone.
Oh dear, oh we've come to the end.
Oy, psst, you are a little fidget.'

Charlotte: 'Where is Adam and Brian?'

Carole: 'Mm?'

Charlotte: 'Where is Adam and Brian?'

Carole: 'They're not having a cigar, they're walking round the block.
They're not having a cigar.
So they keep telling me.'

Pauline: 'They've gone out for a walk to have a cigar but as far we're concerned they're not having a cigar.'

Carole: 'They think we're stupid and we don't realize [UNK]'

Pauline: 'Well, I'm not supposed to tell you but he was smoking on the station when we just caught sight of him.'

Carole: 'Well I'm sure he was.'

Pauline: 'I said how am I not supposed to say anything, I said I don't approve why should I keep this quiet?
Cos it's not good for you.
It's not on.'

Pauline: 'Brian is, because we've been out a couple of times and he does, I mean if we go out he'll smoke then and then he just normally stops.'

Carole: 'Yes, he had one to celebrate, but he didn't just buy one he bought a box.
So of course he had to keep smoking them until he'd finished'

Pauline: 'Until they'd gone, yes.'

Carole: 'And he told me, well quite soon quite soon after she came along.
I think he actually went for a walk with Brian.'

Pauline: 'Oh, I assume he brought [UNK]'

Carole: 'No, no, this was the last one.
I said, you had the last one two days ago.
So the last one of packet number I don't know what.'

Pauline: 'Well Brian can stop [UNK] terrible now, he's really snoring, god [UNK].
I've got to the point now, I kick him and tell him to turn over, he turns it over and it's just as bad as before.'

Carole: 'Yeah, yeah.'

Charlotte: 'I don't want to be married.'

Pauline: 'No, don't bother'

Carole: 'Well at least have separate rooms.'

Pauline: 'I wouldn't mind, but it's normally me that goes and sleeps on the settee and I don't see why I should.
Well, no the other day he said if I'm really that bad you just tell me and I'll go down and sleep on the sofa.
And I went berserk about two nights later and said for god's sake you're driving me bonkers, go away and sleep on the sofa.
He's turned over and started snoring.'

Carole: 'Well he can be lying there sometimes and I'll say, will you roll over please.
Mm.
Go on then.
Mm.
Will you please roll over!
Or some of the time I've been sitting there in the bed feeding the baby, you know'

Pauline: 'Mm.'

Carole: 'and [UNK] go shut up!
Shut up!
It's awful.'

Pauline: 'Well, I've found now I do a combination of what's that stuff, erm, orbathol that seems to help a bit.
I don't think it helps him, it helps me calm down and go to sleep.'

Carole: 'Knock out drops.'

Pauline: '[UNK] put that all over, I keep forgetting to take those herbal tablets, they seem to help with colds or whatever but I haven't got those upstairs at the moment which doesn't help.
And then last night I just took my stuff and knocked myself out instead.
I don't see why I should have to knock myself out [UNK]'

Carole: '[UNK] have to be a man unfortunately.'

Pauline: 'Trouble is I go into such a deep sleep I can't wake up in the morning if I do, you know, take the herbal stuff, I [UNK], I'm flat out in the morning, can't wake up.
I think I got up about half past eight this morning.'

Carole: 'Goodness me.'

Pauline: 'I had to go to work about nine.'

Carole: 'Oh what are you doing?
Oh shut up.
Go away.'

Pauline: 'And he gets hiccups.
He eats too much too quickly.
He gets really violent hiccups though, you know, really th, they sound very, very painful.'

Carole: 'My baby's ones do.'

Pauline: 'Mm.
You know when it, you can just hear everything going ckkk ooh.
Is she awake?'

Carole: 'No.
[UNK] I'll have to put you down some time.'

Pauline: 'I felt so sorry for Christine.
Do you know she's now, she was quite cuddly, she was fat in the pregnancy when I saw her last time.
And in the space of three weeks I think the baby's used up all her fat because she's now just really, really pregnant.
But, not so much her face, but all the top part of her looks slim, almost, you know I mean, she's got no fat left there, on her arms it's all gone.
Just a bit left on her legs so the baby must have used up all if the baby carries on like this she'll be anaemic I think.'

Carole: 'When's she due?
Did you say?'

Pauline: 'Eleventh, so she's got another, almost two, well [UNK] two weeks, ten days.'

Carole: 'Mm.'

Pauline: 'She said she can't sit down, can't stand up.
I was just sitting there for about five minutes then she got up, then she, ooh, sat down, then she got up.
I don't think it can be too long.'

Carole: 'Now what about that then?
I can't believe how quickly the time's gone.'

Pauline: 'Mm.'

Charlotte: '[UNK] Do you want to sit down [UNK]?'

Pauline: '[UNK] broke today.'

Carole: 'Ooh broke?'

Pauline: 'I mean I was, one minute I was walking round, I hadn't touched anything another minute it was catching my finger.
I looked down to see what was kind of stinging my finger and the ring had snapped and was pinching where it caught my finger. [UNK]'

Carole: 'I can't get mine off.'

Pauline: 'Well I can't wear a wedding ring now, it, just cos it's so wide, it's a really wide one.
And if I wear [UNK] where I had the eternity ring on and the engagement ring and the wedding ring [UNK]'

Pauline: 'it just felt like arthritis, it used to get really painful.
So I said oh blow this that's coming off.
I suppose I'll have to get another wedding ring.
It's fashionable to have a kind of [UNK] reason [UNK]'

Pauline: 'I don't think so.
So I'm feeling less and less married the more rings I keep breaking.'

Carole: 'I can't get my wedding ring off.'

Pauline: 'No.
Well, my fingers get swelling as well, so I thought it wouldn't do any harm. [UNK]'

Charlotte: 'Well I have finished [UNK]'

Carole: 'Well they're all up there.'

Charlotte: 'O K.
Well I could not ask you before.'

Carole: 'Well, yeah, if you look, ooh, I can't think where.
I think there's a book-rack up there and I think some of them, the patterns are out of the magazine and they're just, in a rack, I think.
If you go up there just leave them as they are don't leave them all over the place.
[UNK] put them back.'

Pauline: 'Are you making something?'

Carole: 'Depends how much time I've got.'

Charlotte: 'Yeah.'

Pauline: 'What are you going to make?'

Charlotte: 'Some [UNK]'

Pauline: 'Yeah?'

Carole: 'What the ski, lycra type one?'

Charlotte: 'Little?'

Carole: 'Lycra.'

Charlotte: 'Oh that one, no.'

Carole: '[UNK] fabric [UNK].
Do you want the fitted or loose?'

Carole: 'You want like, like that, floaty?'

Carole: 'Like, like these, or, more like jogging pants?'

Charlotte: 'No, like these.'

Carole: 'Well if you want them to stay pretty as opposed to going baggy then you'll need to have a bit of lycra in the fabric.
Keeps the shape better.'

Pauline: 'Mandy loves her top.'

Carole: 'Oh, the body?
The body?'

Pauline: 'Yeah, she was wearing it flat out when she was [UNK]'

Carole: 'So you didn't get a look in then?'

Pauline: 'Oh no, I was wrestling it off to wash it in the end.
She kind of wore it with everything she could think of I think that would go.
Mind you, I don't think it's come out of the washing at the moment, I think it's getting water [UNK].
I haven't seen it recently.'

Carole: 'Quite versatile really.'

Pauline: 'Yeah, yes she wore it with a lot of you know trousers and skirts and The big thing at the moment is a new polo neck that we got from [UNK].
It's actually ever such a good one.
An X Together one, you know Together the label [UNK]?'

Carole: 'So [UNK]'

Pauline: 'Yeah.
But you also buy it in, er, Alders, they've got them.
[UNK]. So it's normally quite expensive and it's, it's lovely material and it comes down to about here.
We got it for four pound fifty.
Ever so cheap.'

Carole: 'That's [UNK]'

Carole: 'Oh, right, yes I've seen it, I've seen it.'

Pauline: 'Well ever so often what they do they get the ex catalogue stuff.
You know you can get some quite good buys like end of the season.'

Carole: 'Who are they?'

Pauline: 'You get the end of season and it's if you look at the labels and go for the decent labels then you don't get sort of, quite reasonable quality.'

Carole: 'Mm.'

Pauline: 'I got quite a few things in there.
I'll probably have a stroll round there just to get a tracksuit for, when Michael was [UNK]'

Carole: '[UNK] childrens' tracksuit.'

Pauline: 'I used to, I bought loads and loads in there.'

Carole: 'Joelle?
Could you just take the carrycot up and put it on the floor?
Just so that it's upstairs, for me.'

Charlotte: 'On the floor? [UNK] bedroom floor?'

Carole: 'Well I haven't cleared the cot out, so'

Charlotte: 'O K.'

Pauline: '[UNK] it's funny cos I just I thought ooh, I'll buy it for her cos you know she doesn't [UNK]'

Pauline: 'four pound fifty I didn't mind.
[UNK]. But it actually really suits her, it's a kind of sl almost maroony red, burgundy type red, not quite and er it's a really good colour.
[UNK] Christine got a load of her pregnancy stuff there.
Cos she said I'm not paying a fortune for stuff that I won't wear afterwards.
So she bought [UNK]'

Carole: 'Is there maternity clothes then?'

Pauline: 'Well, if you look, yeah.
Well she got a kind of raincoat, that, I don't think it's supposed to be maternity I think it's just supposed to be [UNK]'

Carole: '[UNK] Oh yes, cos that was the fashion wasn't it?'

Pauline: 'Yeah, yeah.
So she's, she's got one there.
I think she paid [UNK] eight pound for it, and it, it looks [UNK] raincoat [UNK].
And it still fits, it still fits over the hump.
But she's huge.'

Carole: 'I really got away with it, you know.
I, didn't have a coat right the way through.'

Pauline: 'Mm.
[UNK] when it rains, that's all.'

Carole: 'Really lucky. [UNK]'

Pauline: '[UNK] she hasn't got a car, or anything.
She's'

Carole: 'Oh, dear.'

Pauline: 'So she has to walk round well, Chris sold his car didn't he cos they want to save up and get a house.'

Carole: 'Even through the snow I survived.
Very lucky.
Cos I refused to go out and buy a coat.'

Pauline: 'I used to wear one [UNK]'

Carole: 'I had a jumper that my mum knitted that went wrong and ended up twice the size it should have been.
But that came in useful.'

Pauline: 'Yeah.
Well, when Mandy was when I was pregnant with Mandy I used to wear this old, you know those rabbit skin coats [UNK] coney coat what they're called?
Fur coat thing.'

Carole: 'Mm.'

Pauline: 'Well it was a kind of fur coat but it was rabbit I think, it was.
I got one, ooh, well it was really fashionable then so it was quite beautiful sixteen years ago.'

Carole: 'I'd probably know what you mean if I saw it.'

Pauline: 'It's just a little jacket kind of thing.
So when I was pregnant that would be, that was fine cos it just [UNK]'

Carole: 'Sat on top?'

Pauline: 'Yeah, sat on top really.
And er with Michael I'd gone out in Richard's and bought mys, ever such a full raincoat when it was in fashion.
I still had it in the wardrobe so I just used to [UNK].
But I still had more room than I needed in that so that was quite useful.
Actually Christine [UNK] normal size twelve dress that happened to be a full dress.'

Carole: 'Oh, a baggy one.'

Pauline: 'And she's, she's quite [UNK] it's a kind of cottony, stretchy, you know those ones that you have a V and then they're quite full, like this is full from there?'

Carole: 'Oh, I know, yeah.'

Pauline: 'This is like a V.
Well the V's just kind of gone up.
It actually looked quite nice on her.
She didn't look too bad considering.'

Carole: 'I hardly wore any dresses.'

Pauline: 'Well she's got, she said she just wears the three, I don't think she likes like the trousers.'

Carole: 'Oh it's boring, isn't it, being pregnant?
Because you don't want to go and buy as many clothes as you would have in your wardrobe normally.'

Pauline: 'The killer is when you've got to go out to a special occasion isn't it?'

Carole: 'Yes.'

Pauline: 'And you know you've got to [UNK]'

Pauline: 'Yeah.
I bought this really expensive one, you know I was [UNK] can't remember [UNK] a wedding or something so I had to buy something.
Finished your discussion?'

Carole: 'You enjoyed your non-smoking did you?'

Adam: 'Sorry?'

Carole: 'You enjoyed your non-smoking did you?'

Pauline: 'Is it cold out?'

[UNK]: 'No [UNK] mild.

Pauline: 'Mm.

Carole: 'He doesn't even like it.'

Pauline: 'He doesn't like trout?'

Carole: 'Well he does, but he won't eat it.'

Pauline: 'Why won't you eat it?'

Carole: 'I suggest having trout for dinner, no.
Don't fancy it.'

Adam: 'I like er'

Carole: '[UNK] we've actually had trout in the freezer for ages, and not used them [UNK] fresh the day I got them [UNK] I'll use it and'

Adam: 'I'm keen on trout if it's got a sauce.'

Carole: 'Mm.'

Adam: 'But to be honest I shouldn't be eating that sort of thing anyway, so'

Pauline: 'I like it best with almonds, flaked almonds on the top.'

Adam: 'Mm.'

Pauline: 'And that's not on my diet either.'

Carole: 'Actually onions and mushrooms in garlic butter'

Adam: 'How've you been doing?'

Pauline: 'Oh alright, yeah.
Last, I broke it last night [UNK] didn't have enough time cos I was, if I'm doing his books all afternoon.'

Adam: 'Mm.'

Pauline: 'And I didn't have time to cook so he went out, cos I broke it last night [UNK], well I was alright up to lunchtime.
It's dinner time again.
I shall start again tomorrow.
Other than that I don't usually break it.'

Adam: 'How much have you lost?'

Pauline: 'I haven't really lost, in weight I haven't lost any more but it's coming, my body's'

Adam: 'It's shaping you up?'

Pauline: 'Yeah, yes.
Cos, kind of, all my clothes [UNK]'

Adam: 'You look a bit thinner in the face and neck.'

Pauline: 'Yeah.
I think it's maybe it's turned to muscle, I don't know.'

Carole: 'Redistributing'

Pauline: 'Yeah, yeah.
I don't know how to describe it.
Cos I'm not actually losing weight, but my clothes all feel, you know I can get into clothes I haven't worn for ages.'

Adam: 'Mm.'

Carole: 'Well Suzy's going to Weightwatchers again.'

Pauline: 'Is she?'

Carole: 'She doesn't look like she needs to really.'

Pauline: 'She's put on a little bit of weight.'

Carole: 'She has put on a bit, but'

Adam: 'I tell you what Suzy, Suzy's problem is her rump and her her'

Pauline: 'Yeah her legs.'

Adam: 'and her thighs.
That's where she'

Carole: 'Because if you look at the top of her, you you wouldn't think'

Adam: 'No, you wouldn't think she was overweight.
Take a picture of her head and shoulders.'

Carole: 'Mm.
You'd think she was skinny.'

Adam: 'Mm.'

Carole: 'Well, she went right down to a size ten when she lost all that weight before.'

Adam: 'What is she now?'

Carole: 'Fourteen.'

Adam: 'Blimey.'

Pauline: 'Mm.
So she has got a problem then.'

Carole: 'It's all round the bottom.
Mind you, cycling should help that.
She's out cycling here and getting the train in the morning.
Keeps her bike in the garage and pops on the train.'

Adam: 'So you don't need a lot of [UNK]'

Carole: '[UNK] in the garage.'

Pauline: 'No that's right.'

Adam: '[UNK] jacket.
Mind you, isn't there some restrictions on what you can do with fridges?'

Pauline: 'I think you can ask the council to take it away or something or take it to the dump'

[UNK]: 'you can take it down the tip, [UNK]'

Carole: 'They recycle CFC's don't they?'

Pauline: 'That's right, yeah.'

Adam: 'Really goes against the grain to see [UNK].'

Pauline: 'Mm.
Well we don't really need another one.
We've got a fridge in the [UNK] at work, there's one in the kitchen'

Carole: 'Can't you find [UNK]'

Adam: 'Can't you find what?'

Carole: '[UNK] or something?'

Pauline: 'Well it's difficult, isn't it really?
Because it's, it's er under, under worktop [UNK]'

Carole: 'Well, if, if they enquire they're only enquiring [UNK].'

Pauline: 'That's true.
Just ask for a fiver.
Cos if you say nothing they probably think there's something wrong'

Carole: 'not working so they don't want to take it.
[UNK] have to get somebody to take it away.'

Adam: 'Well I think it's going to be a case of phone the council and ask them to [UNK]'

Pauline: 'Do they take them?'

Adam: 'I don't think I'll get it in the car anyway.'

Pauline: 'Who's asleep proper now?'

Carole: '[UNK] now isn't she?
Pardon?'

Adam: 'She gone?'

Carole: 'I'm not sure.'

Pauline: 'Well how much does it cost to get in the cinema [UNK]?'

Adam: 'About four quid isn't it.'

Carole: 'Is it?
I'll have to buy the tickets occasionally.'

Adam: 'I think it's about three, three seventy five.
Something like that.'

Pauline: 'Oh, cos Joelle was trying to, trying to work out if she can afford to have her hair done and go to the cinema.'

Adam: 'What does she wanna go and see?'

Pauline: 'White Fang.'

Adam: 'White what?'

Pauline: 'It's the latest Walt Disney.
It's a story about a wolf.'

Adam: 'Oh that one.'

[UNK]: '[UNK] Fantasia.'

Carole: 'What'd you say?'

Pauline: 'We want to go and see that [UNK]'

Adam: 'Fantasia's coming out [UNK]'

Carole: 'It's a last, last ditch attempt to get some money out of it, is it?'

Adam: 'And what was the other one?'

[UNK]: 'I was told, wasn't I?
Fantasia and'

Carole: 'It wasn't one we wanted'

Pauline: 'Hundred and One Dalmatians?'

Carole: 'No, no, we would have wanted that.'

Carole: 'Oh yeah that's it.
Yes it was, yeah'

Adam: '[UNK] latest one, it made a massive, massive loss apparently.'

Pauline: 'I shouldn't bother about it [UNK].
It's so boring.'

Carole: 'I'd like Fantasia.
I'd probably be sad and disappointed.
My memory of it would probably be [UNK].'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, of course you saw it as a kid, didn't you?'

Carole: '[UNK] fifteen I think.
Fifteen, sixteen.'

Pauline: 'Oh no I saw it when I was about eight.'

Carole: 'And I saw it before that, about, yeah about eight as well.
But I still enjoyed it the second time.'

Pauline: 'Well I don't think actually, I mean I can remember [UNK] and I don't quite understand what's going on here, keeps swapping and changing and I don't understand it.'

Carole: 'I remember I didn't like the orchestra bit.
[UNK] weird psychedelic bits.'

Pauline: 'That's right, yeah.'

Carole: 'The Nutcracker Suite's my favourite.
Hippos and things doing ballet dances.'

Adam: '[UNK] asleep.'

Carole: 'No, she's not asleep.'

Adam: 'I thought you said she was asleep.'

Carole: 'She was.
She's just woken up.

Pauline: 'Do you remember [UNK] provisional driving licence?

Ages isn't it I thought I'd tidy up in his desk and I was just going through the mound of papers, and I said here you are here's your licence, finish it off, fill it in, and I'll give you the cheque.
Oh right, I'll and then she's moaning at him cos she wants to go and post it and you were mucking about with your C D thing or something and you were saying wait for me I'll do this [UNK] then [UNK] I'll miss the post.
It's been sitting there for about three months.
On the desk and she hasn't bothered [UNK] probably with the cheque.'

[UNK]: '[UNK] How are you going to afford a driving licence?
Totally ignored me.'

Pauline: 'Oh, of course, expecting us to pay.'

Carole: 'Oh, that's a nice choccy.'

Pauline: 'She sounded really cheesed off about [UNK] I said how's your revision going, cos I knew she was doing revision, she went cccckkk I try a maths paper and I can't do that, and I [UNK] a chemistry paper and I can't do that and I really.
I said I think you need a break.
I think you need to go and do something else for a little while I said cos if you keep looking over thinking you can't do it, have a break and go back to it afterwards you just get really despondent'

Carole: 'Yeah.'

Pauline: 'and fed up and think you can't do it and you go blank and then you can't touch anything you and you know it's hard.'

Carole: 'Mm.'

Pauline: 'Yeah.
You know, you can see it ticking over [UNK].
What am I doing.
She was fine tonight, wasn't she?'

Carole: 'What was she doing?'

Pauline: 'I dunno, I think she just, probably gone down and played some records or something [UNK].
She's got to do some trigs and she just doesn't fancy trying, doesn't understand enough of it to do it.
And the science paper she's only got the the kind of practice one, it's a very basic one.
She's got no practice ones for the two, the other two she's got to do which are obviously going to be harder and she's got no idea, not, well she's got the guidelines but no real paper to sit and look at.'

Carole: 'Mm.'

Adam: 'This is for GCSEs isn't it?'

Pauline: 'Yeah.'

Adam: 'Mm.'

Pauline: 'Well you'd think they'd let her, you know have some old paper [UNK]'

Adam: 'Does she have [UNK] or not?'

Pauline: 'Yes, she erm'

Carole: 'There aren't any old papers yet though are there?'

Pauline: 'Well yeah this is done in Croydon last year and the year before so yeah there would be a couple'

Carole: 'Oh right.'

Pauline: 'cos this was Croydon I'm pretty sure it yeah because otherwise she couldn't have the basic from last year would she?
She's got last year's basic.
Yes she's done er, both, three?'

[UNK]: '[UNK] four'

Pauline: 'Well on Tuesday she goes in and goes, she's got till Tuesday, one's about six and one's five.'

Pauline: 'Bit easier, is it?'

Adam: 'Yes.'

Carole: 'Doesn't want to be a doctor any more.'

Adam: 'She's wanted to be a doctor for six years now she's decided'

Pauline: 'One of Mandy's friends wants to be a doctor.
It's the one who's had cancer and she wants to kind of, go on and study and help the people with cancer.
Cos she doesn't want to be like depressing, she said er no she doesn't feel like that because she's already gone through the worst so she won't, yeah she wants to help people who've got it.
Which I thought was quite nice.'

Adam: 'Mm.'

Pauline: 'Nice idea.'

Adam: 'Mind you, that's what motivated my brother in M S'

Pauline: 'Mm.'

Adam: 'cos he had a, he had it, had it as a kiddy.
Went through so many operations he felt he wanted to give something back to the Health Service.'

Pauline: 'Well I think that's the kind of idea this girl's got.
Cos, that's right we took, we took them all skating when Mandy was twelve [UNK].
Yeah when she was twelve.
And that's when, that week, well she already knew she had something wrong [UNK]'

Adam: 'Mm.'

Pauline: 'and about two weeks after that it was diagnosed that she had cancer of the ovary.
Yeah.'

Adam: 'Cos she had all her bits removed, presumably did she?'

Pauline: 'Yeah I presume so.
She had quite a bit of work done.
She had chemotherapy.
She lost all her hair.'

Adam: 'Has it all come back?'

Pauline: 'Oh yeah.
She's all fine now.'

Adam: 'Is she fully full recovered?'

Pauline: 'Yeah, I think so, yeah.
From what I can gather.'

Adam: 'Very lucky.'

Pauline: 'Mm.
Yeah because [UNK] it was pushing everything.
You know it was taking up so much space.
Wouldn't think there was the room in there for, for women.
I was really worried at the time cos Mandy, Mandy was very worried, wasn't she?'

[UNK]: 'Mhm.'

Pauline: 'It really seemed to hit her hard.
Actually her friends have gone through a lot.
I mean what with that girl and cancer, and then another good friend, her father died.
Then, it's quite a lot to happen, isn't it?
Really makes her think.
Or worry. [UNK]'

Carole: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'Whose father died then?'

Pauline: 'Celestian's'

[UNK]: 'Oh Christ.'

Pauline: 'He had, er, sickle cell, didn't he?
Oh that funny version of sickle cell, wasn't very nice.'

Carole: 'Didn't know there was two versions of [UNK].'

Adam: 'How's that, er, Phil [UNK] getting on with bringing up her, her baby?'

Carole: 'We haven't heard anything for [UNK]'

Pauline: 'I think she's alright yes.
I don't think she does anything, well I don't really see her very much.
Well her best friend's [UNK]'

Adam: 'Well it must be, nearly two by now.'

Pauline: 'Yeah, she's walking and, she's slow at walking though.
Yeah, she looks alright.
[UNK] says she's not very well, she's got a thyroid infection, infection in her throat it's affecting her stomach.
They took her down the hospital.
And, they diagnosed that, and said try and keep, you know, give her fluids, but it's going straight through.
And they've given her something low in glucose and that you know to kind of try and stabilize it a bit.'

Adam: 'Mhm.'

Pauline: 'But she's not too good by the sounds of it.
Mind you I saw her two day's ago and she looked absolutely fit as a fiddle so I said I think it strikes quickly and'

Adam: 'Mm.'

Carole: 'You know she looks a lot more comfortable in there than Charlotte did.
Charlotte always looked sort of'

Adam: 'Scrunched up.'

Pauline: 'She seems to like it [UNK]'

Carole: 'It's the longest she's stayed in it.

What, oh, perhaps cos I never [UNK] We might just about be able to see.'

Carole: 'You haven't got [UNK] have you?'

Carole: ', I didn't know that one had gone, usually it's the bulb over there that had gone, but I find it so difficult to get at, you change it.
I didn't know this.'

Carole: 'I don't know about this one, [UNK].'

Carole: 'Well of course.'

Carole: 'Mm, shall we start with, with a Tchaikovsky, see how that is going?'

Carole: 'Mhm.'

Carole: 'It's coming on very well, isn't it?'

Carole: 'I'm afraid this last week hasn't been wonderful for, for practice.'

Carole: 'For practice.'

Carole: 'I understand absolutely, I, I could say exactly the same so, don't [UNK].'

## 004205

Carole: 'Lovely, very, very, good indeed, that, that is there now, sounds very good, just, erm, a few little things, would you try to give me more on the fifth finger, the E, the E flat, there, think of a crescendo, to that, want that come out, then, then it will, erm, I'm almost frightened to put a crescendo in because it wasn't the, a big one.'

Carole: 'No.'

Carole: 'If I put that in, to remind you to bring that up.'

Carole: 'Aha.'

Carole: 'I thought this was most impressive, very, very good indeed, it it was, it sounded really very convincing, it did, worked beautifully, now, where, the only error as such, is this bar, you're making these much too long, you're making them almost crotchet length.'

Carole: 'Mm.'

Carole: 'But, so erm, just think there for a moment, one, two, one, two, and one, and two, and, you're going one and two and one and'

Carole: 'And'

Carole: 'So you're halving the tempo, but, it needs a slight roe that means just lead into it, so,, two and one, can do that, but you're doing,, and it's instable for ever.'

Carole: 'Right.'

Carole: 'And then, you know, it, it, makes that sound strange, so just watch that, that, erm, what if we just pick it up around here, just for me to hear that and get that right, we ought to be fine, any [UNK].'

Carole: 'And one and two, that's it, got it, erm, the, better we just do to check that it's correct and [UNK] to remind you for rhythm, is listen to those, because those are exactly the same as those.'

Carole: 'Yeah.'

Carole: 'Just once again this time [UNK].'

Carole: 'Two and one and two and one and, now there you just make the crotchet a bit too short, erm, try until you get it into your system, which you will, just counting that, in, inside yourself.'

Carole: 'Mhm.'

Carole: 'And you'll find then that, that, that will fit, can you just adjust your [UNK]?'

Carole: 'This?'

Carole: 'Yes.'

Carole: 'Work out what fingers should be.'

Carole: 'F sharp.'

Carole: 'And one, two and [UNK] and, you've got it, yeah, yeah, do it once again, and try, the other thing, is try not to hold down that D, as you play the C, it's not important, but, it's better if you don't.'

## 004206

Carole: 'Oh goodness me, can I go home?'

Carole: 'I want [UNK] to have a look at, at this first, or the, the other piece or would you like to'

Carole: 'Yeah, maybe.'

Carole: 'Yes, there, there hasn't been'

Carole: 'This, this happens from time to time doesn't it?'

Carole: 'Oh I know, erm, with all of us, I understand completely, whilst that you feel a beat in it, erm, no where your left hand has to play, left hand seemed to be er leading a mind of it's own, yes.'

Carole: 'All over the place. [UNK]'

Carole: 'Do it once again.'

Carole: 'Yes.'

Carole: '[UNK], do it a bit slower, one, two, three, feel it, [UNK] steady.'

## 004207

Carole: 'Yes, that, that was almost that you have a complex about it.'

Carole: 'Still not right.
Well I didn't have,'

Carole: '[UNK], but you do now.'

Carole: 'Erm, it's, it's fine, it's, they were little slips, are you practising your left hand on it's own?'

Carole: 'Eh, I haven't been this week.'

Carole: 'I would.'

Carole: 'I've just been doing it together.'

Carole: 'I think just a few times'

Carole: 'Mhm.'

Carole: 'would would help it, it's it's not quite secure enough, because it might have been before I arrived, but all the weaknesses show up'

Carole: 'Yes I know.'

Carole: 'you know, so erm, I, I think a little left hand practice would solve it, I noticed that you put a five on that, I think it's better if you put a four.'

Carole: 'Yes.'

Carole: 'Whether you will or not is another matter, that, try it again, and no faster than that, very, very sturdy, very sturdy.'

## 004208

Carole: 'It needs [UNK] practice.'

Carole: 'Yes.'

Carole: 'Well, because it's, it's rather a case of the blind leading the the blind, erm'

Carole: 'I think they're both [UNK] separately, but they'

Carole: 'Yes, now you, you played stuff just as difficult as this, and [UNK] there's no, no problem, don't do it too quickly though, and, I don't mind if it's not finished next week, or the week after, it's the quality we want, so, so, don't, don't rush it.
Just, if I were you I'd just do a little on it, every time you practised, and then put it away.'

Carole: 'Mhm.'

Carole: 'But, what, insist on, on left hand especially the little finger being really firm, so I shall leave you with that, that piece'

Carole: 'and wait excitedly, you know next week.'

Carole: 'Mm.'

Carole: 'How one pages the other six.'

Carole: 'That's it.'

Carole: 'Right.'

Carole: 'Done it separately.'

Carole: 'Oh yes,, then [UNK] except miracles.'

Carole: 'No I, no, I mean you really respond very well, that Tchaikovsky was lovely, I understand at the present you can't do as much and admirable as you're still doing.'

Carole: 'Well I have to have something to do by myself.'

Carole: 'Yes, well yes surely make that or otherwise you, if you give up everything.'

Carole: 'Yeah, even if it's only ten minutes a day, at least it's something.'

Carole: 'Oh yes, yes, I think we all need, even, even if, plain, life is full of playing games and the game can help you get through the day sometimes.'

Carole: 'That's right.'

Carole: 'So, right let's hear the right hand.'

Carole: 'Yeah, just erm, that was fine, fingering here, erm, why do you put a, put a four on that, I, I would of thought that, that is more sensible, you put [UNK] into the next note down, let's try that, er mm'

## 004209

Carole: 'Now do you know where two is in your mind?'

Carole: 'Mm.'

Carole: '[UNK], sorry the and, do you know where it comes in the troll?'

Carole: 'In the middle.'

Carole: 'Yes, on that F sharp, right.'

Carole: 'Mm, one and two and, lovely, that's it, got it?'

Carole: 'Mhm.'

Carole: 'Though watch the beat there, then we'll be fine, good, let's go on.'

Carole: 'Yeah, now, are you going to put an F you put a four on that, so if you're doing it there, do a four also.'

Carole: 'What on the A you mean?'

Carole: '[UNK], yes on the A.'

Carole: 'Oh right.'

Carole: '[UNK] the same.'

Carole: 'What was I doing?'

Carole: 'Put a five.'

Carole: 'Oh right.'

Carole: '[UNK] making life difficult.'

Carole: 'Difficult.'

Carole: ', just try it.'

Carole: 'Then a four.'

Carole: 'Good.
Yes, now I wouldn't slur those quite so much as I would make that all legato.
You try putting a thumb on the A, no do, do this slowly, making the whole thing legato.'

Carole: 'The thumb da, da, yes, but, if you're in it's a cord of G, you'll put a two on the B, final note, and then go up to a five on a G, not a one, it's better [UNK] to do that, see if you can try.'

Carole: 'That's it, do you find that difficult?'

Carole: 'No, just awkward.'

Carole: 'If, if, if you can't, if you prefer to put a one there cross it out with a vengeance.'

Carole: '[UNK] Well I [UNK].'

Carole: 'Take a rubber to it.'

Carole: 'I try to [UNK].'

Carole: 'And, it's, it's better roll than keep on using the thumb to get you out of the keyboard but, if, I don't want it to spoil'

Carole: 'Well I see, if it, if it.'

Carole: 'See how it goes, but that's, that's good, now let me just [UNK].'

Carole: 'Good, very good [UNK].'

## 004210

Carole: 'Yes, very good, and you're sure you haven't put a three on that aren't you?'

Carole: 'Of course.'

Carole: 'Good nothing wrong with that, nothing wrong at all, now I think rather than set you something new, it's better to, try to get another bar.'

Carole: 'Think so.'

Carole: 'So, concentrate on this and I'm, I'm, must get round to [UNK], I'm sorry my life has been in turmoil because of the, the dog situation, Jean and I haven't been up to the West End, but erm, I, I know which book I want, I want to get you, erm, and yes, I want you to do this, so [UNK] and this actually it's very good, very difficult, good, do a bit of technic.'

Carole: 'Why not?'

Carole: 'Have you, have you been spending hours on the technic?'

Carole: 'Oh absolutely.'

Carole: 'The'

Carole: 'Yes.'

Carole: 'And I've just about managed to get staccato in the right hand.'

Carole: 'Do you a lot of good, you'll thank me for it one day.'

Well, she her, her sleeping habits during the day change to afternoons, and, well today she's been she had about two hours this afternoon, so if we did our normal and gave her tea at five o'clock, and send them up for a bath at half past six, there's no way she'd be asleep.'

Carole: 'So, seems to be working.'

Carole: 'Well this one seems to go to bed a bit later now, so she goes longer, but she's feeding all day today, [UNK], I'm at [UNK] every couple of hours, so with a bit of luck, I'll finally put her to bed maybe half past nine ten o'clock, she might go through till three or four, which isn't bad.'

Carole: 'Mm.'

Adam: 'so'

Carole: '[UNK] concerts and things, but you can, you can tell, with just, just by listening that it's not just any old body tinkling on the piano, it's wonderful, it makes you sick.'

Adam: 'Is Charlotte going to learn to play it?'

Carole: 'Well I hope she'll be interested enough to, but, not really before she's six, cos I asked him last couple of times ago, he said, what sort of age, cos obviously the size of the hands comes into it, they can't do too much, but he said he wouldn't consider before six and you ought'a have to take the parents into consideration, of a child that age you gotta have a parent who's prepared to sit there and make sure the child does what he's set them to do, because [UNK], oh Amy, you not getting any [UNK] out of that.
Have you finished it?
Ha, you big lump.
No wonder she puts on half a pound a week.
Mind you erm, I mean that's not, it's normal, I expect you to put between six, six ounces and eight ounces [UNK].
Oh dear, oh dear, it's a hard life isn't it?'

Adam: 'I had to, Richard had taken the car [UNK], he takes it in the morning, but'

Carole: 'Oh my goodness, [UNK].'

Adam: 'Well he he takes the car to school, but, and it, sorry takes the car to work and before he's bringing the car home and then he's been going to school on his bike.'

Carole: 'Oh right.'

Adam: 'So of course the bike, the car's for me to use in the evening, but last'

Carole: 'You cycle home from here and then [UNK]?'

Adam: '[UNK] from you, then you get changed and then go, but, last week he took the car, cos when I got home, first I was late last Wednesday, well I say late, I didn't get back here, erm, until seven, so by the time I got home it was quarter past seven and I have to make sure I get to Weightwatchers between seven and eight.'

Carole: 'Oh, for the weigh in?'

Adam: 'Mm, so I had to go, quickly get changed, and cos it, it, I normally I just wear a pair, a pair of sandals and light weight clothing, but'

Carole: 'Oh dear.'

Adam: 'so, I couldn't go in sandals, well obviously I can't cycle in a pair of sandals on'

Carole: 'Can't really cycle with a floating skirt on either, can you?'

Adam: 'The last [UNK] with me leggings on and this top on.
Well, I looked a bit of a sight, but I thought well, well, you know, what else can I do, I mean I couldn't take clothing to get changed in to.'

Carole: 'Well, they wouldn't expect you to would they?'

Adam: 'I've, I'd got a few stares from some of the women there, I mean, there are some women there that are huge, and maybe they looked at me and thought oh I hope I can wear leggings like that one day, I mean I don't think I look too bad in the leggings, I mean I would never have done it when I used to go to Weightwatchers when I was thirteen and a half stone, I would never of gone in leggings, no way, but it doesn't'

Carole: 'Well you don't, you don't really look as if you need to lose weight cos it's probably why you got a few stares, it's like all the diet books that have sylphlike people on the front.'

Adam: 'Well [UNK].
I mean I spoke to Jane the other Sunday and I, I said to her you know, just be honest, I said I don't care what you said, but just be honest and tell me how much you think I weigh, cos she doesn't know how much I weigh and she thought I weighed about ten stone, I said well stick thirteen pounds on top of that, then you'll be right, she couldn't believe that I, that I weighed that much, so obviously it doesn't look that bad and people at work, well they've noticed that I've lost weight, but they don't say how much they think I weigh, so I don't want [UNK] come to them to sort of, have a, have a g have a guess of my weight.'

Carole: 'Guess the weight of a Suzie.'

Adam: 'Yeah, but they have noticed which is something I suppose.
There's somebody came in today, a guy came in today who used to work with us who usually comes in occasionally and I would see him, but for a few weeks now, so he noticed it.
It's nice that people say it to you unprompted.'

Carole: 'Oh yes, you say I'm on a diet, they say oh well you have lost a lot of weight then.'

Adam: 'Yeah.'

Carole: 'Adam's mum's like that.'

Adam: 'Oh is she?'

Carole: 'She knows you're dieting, every time she sees you, ooh you've lost a lot of weight.'

Adam: 'Even when you haven't, yeah, but erm, no I mean, there is a guy at work, I mean there is a guy at work that's constantly saying to me, oh it's really noticing, it's really started, he says this every day, and he, after a while, I mean it's nice to be told it, once in a while, but not every day.'

Carole: 'But not every day, it loses value doesn't it?'

Adam: 'Oh it does, and he said to me, erm this afternoon, he said eh, oh he said eh, your weight loss is really, really noticing this week, and I thought well, even if I had lost weight this week it's only going to be a couple of pounds, and a couple of pounds would not notice.'

Carole: 'Plus the different clothes you wear.'

Adam: 'It doesn't matter who you are, two pounds won't make any difference to your appearance, I mean, yeah I suppose clotheswise'

Carole: 'Well as you, as you get smaller, two pounds does notice, it's when you're'

Adam: 'Maybe it does.'

Carole: 'when you're bigger, and you've got a real lot to lose, and two pounds is nothing.'

Adam: 'Yeah, two pound is nothing, yes that's true.'

Carole: 'Two pounds is actually quite a lot.'

Adam: 'Yes it is.'

Carole: 'Good evening.
My goodness me how many have you caught?
Have you got a whopper in there?'

Adam: 'Yes.'

Adam: 'I's gonna say the bags [UNK] full.'

Carole: 'Goodness.
So, so your new leader did the trick.'

Carole: 'God you need, my god.'
