We need to leave them some to swim in before we catch them.
Just a little bit more.'

Dorothy: 'Gently Tim.'

Christopher: 'Why can't we leave them in that water?'

Dorothy: 'Well what do you think would happen to the poor things if left them in that water?'

Christopher: 'I don't know.'

Dorothy: 'Do you know that fish can't breathe unless they're in water?
So if they're out of the water they die just like if we're under the water too long we die.
Right, I think we should stop now and get them out of there.
Stop Tim.'

Tim: 'I I [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Can I borrow this, this cup now to fish these fish out.

You don't need to do that now look cos I can just carry the thing into the kitchen.
Come and help me with the stones in the kitchen.'

Christopher: 'I've got some stones.'

Dorothy: 'No no.

Dorothy: 'When we've what?'

Christopher: 'more water in when you're ready to put more water in, can I get the water and put it in the jug and pour it in?'

Dorothy: 'Yeah, if you want to.
We've actually got clean water in there cos that's clean water that's in the bucket that the fish are swimming in now.'

Tim: 'Hello [UNK].'

Dorothy: 'Hello.
I've lost the brush.
We need a brush for this.
Oh here we are.
Right.'

Tim: 'My favourite dinner.'

Dorothy: 'Is it your favourite dinner?
Do you know what it is?'

Tim: 'Yeah.'

Dorothy: 'It's meant to be cottage pie but I've put some'

Tim: 'What?'

Dorothy: 'I've put some breadcrumbs on the top instead of cheese.
Because we seem to like that at the moment don't we?
It needs to go in the oven really.'

Tim: 'What?'

Dorothy: 'It needs to go in the oven really.'

Dorothy: 'Pardon?
What did you say?'

Tim: 'I really [UNK] this time.'

Dorothy: 'Really tatty?'

Tim: 'Mm.
Really tatty.'

Dorothy: 'What?
Oh you mean the stones.
Yeah.
It's quite it's quite erm'

Tim: 'Are the fish tatty?'

Dorothy: 'It's a long time, no no no, it's a long time we since we er cleaned them.
It's just dirty really rather than tatty.
Whoops.'

Christopher: '[UNK] water at me.'

Dorothy: 'Pardon?'

Christopher: 'Tim's throwing water at me.'

Dorothy: 'Tim, what are you doing?
Can you come in here Tim so I can see you please.
Tim.
Let's go and see what he's up to.
Come on.
What are you doing?
You're not throwing water are you?'

Tim: 'No.'

Dorothy: 'No we'll all get wet if you do.
Cos we're not, we don't want a bath.'

Tim: 'Why [UNK].'

Dorothy: 'Why what?'

Tim: 'Why do you need to wash the [UNK]?'

Dorothy: 'Cos they're cos they're messy.
Look you can see it's all brown.
Ugh.
If we just wipe round the outside of the tank though, I think that will help.
Cos it's gone all funny inside, can you see?'

Tim: 'Yeah.'

Dorothy: 'Whoops.
Ugh look at that.'

Christopher: 'Ugh.'

Dorothy: 'I think it's the kind of food we're using cos it's different food from the food that we had at the beginning.
It didn't seem to get as bad as this at the beginning.'

Christopher: 'Why didn't it seem to get as bad as this?'

Dorothy: 'I don't know.
It just did n't.'

Christopher: 'Is it because mummy'

Dorothy: 'Pardon?'

Christopher: 'Is it because we've given them a different have we already used a pot up?'

Dorothy: 'Yes we used the little pot and then we bought that box.'

Tim: 'Mummy.'

Dorothy: 'Hello.'

Christopher: 'Where's the little pot mummy?'

Dorothy: 'What's your problem?
You alright?'

Tim: 'I wanted to put water in there.'

Dorothy: 'You want to put water in?
Well we'll just give them one more swish.'

Christopher: 'Little pot mum.'

Dorothy: 'What little pot?
The fish food you mean?
Well the thing was, because we bought a box and the box was a bit flimsy, I thought we would put the new fish food into the old pot, you see.
So the old pot has still got some in but it's really the new food.
Do you see?'

Christopher: 'Why didn't you keep it in the box?'

Dorothy: 'There's still some food in there as well.
Right, okay.
If you want to put your jug of water in now, this is your moment.
Do you want to get a jug full.
Do you want to get some from the tap?'

Christopher: 'Why?'

Dorothy: 'You can if you want to.
Because it'll probably need more than what's in the bucket anyway.
Tim, do you want to carry this?'

Tim: 'What?'

Dorothy: 'Do you want to carry this?'

Tim: 'What?'

Dorothy: 'This tank.'

Tim: 'Want to [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Can you manage?
Don't drop it will you?
Shall I hold the cup.
Don't drop it whatever you do.'

Christopher: 'Mum, do you want it up to'

Dorothy: 'Fill it up to the number one there look.
That means one pint.'

Christopher: 'Mum could you'

Dorothy: 'What?'

Christopher: 'turn it on.'

Dorothy: 'Okay.'

Christopher: 'I've done it.'

Dorothy: 'There we are.
Put the dinner in.
Ooh.
Oh well done.
Right, away you go, see if you can get it in the'

Tim: 'Can I have the cup now?'

Christopher: 'Oh Tim don't make hole will you?'

Tim: 'No.'

Christopher: 'Right do it like this.'

Dorothy: 'Oops.'

Christopher: 'Tim's made a hole.'

Dorothy: 'I think you're doing it a bit roughly Tim.
Can you do it more gently so the stones don't move.'

Christopher: 'Don't just pour it in one place.
You're making another hole.'

Dorothy: 'Put, tip it on to the bridge and then you won't make a hole cos the bridge will be in the way.
Oop!
What a dilly.
Ah no.
If you're gonna do it like that we're gonna have to stop you from doing it.
Come on.'

Dorothy: 'Mind the fish.
Poor things.
That's better Tim.
Oh no!
Disaster.
Move the video quick.
Make sure it's dried.'

Christopher: 'It is dried.'

Dorothy: 'Oh!
Now just watch it with those fish please while I get a cloth.'

Tim: 'The bridge is under water.
The bridge is under water now, what will you do?'

Dorothy: 'Yeah.
So is our room look.'

Tim: 'No it's not under water.'

Dorothy: 'It's a good job it's just water and not orange squash.'

Tim: 'Oh!
I caught a fish.'

Tim: 'A fish went in.'

Dorothy: 'Oh Christopher be careful'

Dorothy: 'That was quite clever really.'

Dorothy: 'As long as you didn't hurt him.
There you go mister fish you can go for a swim now.
Now look we've got a fish in there and a fish in there Tim so we must be careful now because otherwise we're gonna hurt them.'

Christopher: 'No there's only one in there.'

Dorothy: 'I think I'd better fish that one out do you?'

Christopher: 'Yeah.
There's already one in there Tim now.'

Dorothy: 'Yeah.
So when you pour the water don't go tipping it'

Christopher: 'There's already one in there.'

Dorothy: 'on top of him cos he'll get a shock.
Let's have this weed out.'

Christopher: '[UNK] one in there already.'

Dorothy: 'You gonna help the weed?
Whoops.
Alright.'

Tim: 'I can't take all of it.'

Dorothy: 'Woo er alright wait a minute now cos mummy's gonna fish this fish out.'

Tim: 'Er Mum, how do you think I caught it?'

Dorothy: 'Oh look at all the bits in there.
I don't know how you caught it love.
It was rather clever really.'

Tim: 'Yeah because when you catch'

Dorothy: 'You've just got to be careful because'

Tim: 'fish then'

Dorothy: 'if you're not careful you'll hurt them you see because if you touch their tails or their fins or something.
There we are.
Right now when you're tipping it in now I should use a cup now Christopher cos the jug will be too much water for them.
Alright?
Now just gently now.'

Tim: 'I I [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Well watch where you're pouring Tim.
Not on top of the fish please.'

Christopher: '[UNK] use that but it's got dirty now.
I'm gonna use that bit.
[UNK]. I'm gonna pour it over there.'

Dorothy: 'Go on then.'

Christopher: 'But that isn't in the way of the bridge.
Oh Tim.'

Dorothy: 'Whoops.
Oh look, next door's got a new car.
Unless it's a visitor.
What do you think?
Got a white one look.'

Christopher: 'Will that be enough water yet?'

Dorothy: 'Er bit more I think.
Gently does it.
That was a good one Tim, well done.'

Tim: 'Oh no.'

Dorothy: 'See if you can tip it without the bits going in then.
Whoop whoop.'

Tim: 'I did.'

Dorothy: 'What?'

Tim: 'I did put a bit in.'

Dorothy: 'Oh well.
Never mind.
It will come out next week.'

Christopher: 'What happens if you put a bit in mum?
The fish might think it's food?'

Dorothy: 'Well er I think those bits that are in there are really just bits of weed.
I don't think it's anything too awful.
What's this thing?
Ooh.
That's a funny thing.'

Tim: 'Will any [UNK]?'

Dorothy: 'I should think so.'

Christopher: 'Or does it nearly'

Dorothy: 'Just a little bit.
I think we've nearly got enough now don't you?'

Christopher: 'Mm.'

Tim: 'No we haven't yet.'

Dorothy: 'Well if we have too much more we shall'

Christopher: 'What?'

Dorothy: 'have it overflowing.'

Christopher: 'And we don't want erm it over if it gets'

Tim: 'I'll g'

Christopher: 'right to the top'

Dorothy: 'Mm?'

Christopher: 'we'll have to stop.'

Dorothy: 'I think we must stop before we get right to the top.'

Tim: 'Why?
I think we're gonna have a [UNK].
This is a laugh.'

Christopher: 'Not very easy to get now.
Is it Tim?'

Dorothy: 'No.'

Tim: 'It is.'

Christopher: 'Look Tim put it down [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Whoops.'

Christopher: '[UNK] not very much left in there now.'

Christopher: '[UNK] have you got it all here?
Oh I think there's only a tiny tiny bit left.
Now who's gonna get it [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'I'll tell you what look.
You hold the cup and I'll tip the bucket, right?
I'll hold your cup.
There you go.
All done.'

Dorothy: 'Right, we need a cloth now to wipe up the bits round the edges.
What are you doing?'

Tim: 'I'm cleaning it.'

Dorothy: 'Well look why don't you have one of these then you can do it properly.'

Tim: 'Can I? [UNK]'

Christopher: 'Now Tim don't wipe in the fish will you?'

Tim: 'Oh dear.
It's in the fish.'

Dorothy: 'Well you're a silly billy you are.
It's the edges you've got to do look, not inside it.'

Christopher: 'What about putting the roof on the [UNK]?'

Dorothy: 'Yeah, we need the roof on don't we?'

Christopher: 'I'll put mine over the [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Mm.
Do you want to pick up the top, the lid please.'

Tim: 'I've got it. [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Except if we're gonna put food in we didn't ought to put it on just yet did we?'

Christopher: 'No but we could put food through there.'

Dorothy: 'Oh we could put food through there.
No you want dry hands cos if you touch the food with wet hands guess what happens?'

Christopher: 'What?'

Dorothy: 'Can you guess?'

Christopher: 'No.'

Dorothy: 'It sticks to your fingers.'

Christopher: 'Have to wash our hands.

Dorothy: 'Yeah, just make sure, oh look at your trousers!
Soaked.

Christopher: 'I just carried [UNK] fall off.'

Tim: 'I've not feeded the food.'

Dorothy: 'Okay well just dry'

Christopher: 'I haven't'

Dorothy: 'your fingers first.'

Christopher: 'feeded a long time.'

Dorothy: 'Well you did the I poured your, the water into your cup so it's Christopher's turn to feed them.'

Christopher: 'What about the box?'

Dorothy: 'Well you don't need the box love cos the box's got some food in but the that's got the rest of it in.'

Christopher: '[UNK] washing my hands.'

Dorothy: 'Well it's okay about washing them, it's the dryness that matters.
Are they dry, your hands?'

Christopher: 'Yeah.'

Dorothy: 'Yeah?
Go on then.
No not too much.'

Christopher: 'Anyway I can't get too much really.'

Dorothy: 'You watch underneath Tim, see if they come up to the top.'

Tim: 'Yeah.'

Dorothy: 'Are they coming?'

Christopher: 'Is that enough?'

Dorothy: 'I should think so.'

Christopher: 'Tiny bit more.'

Dorothy: 'Go on then.
Just a little spot.'

Christopher: 'That's lovely.'

Tim: 'Is that going to come up?'

Christopher: 'They come up?
No.'

Tim: 'They did.'

Dorothy: 'Well they're probably a bit shocked now cos they've got clean water.'

Christopher: 'And their bridge is in the same place.'

Dorothy: 'Not quite.'

Christopher: 'Yeah their bridge was there, yeah.'

Dorothy: 'Was it?
Oh it doesn't matter.'

Tim: 'Oh!'

Dorothy: 'Good.
That's that done.'

Tim: 'There's a er I just saw one eating food.'

Christopher: 'Yes it's gone up.
Is that eating the food or eating the weed?'

Dorothy: 'I don't know.
I'm never sure if they eat this weed cos it doesn't look as if it's going anywhere.'

Christopher: 'Mum, can we watch [UNK]?'

Dorothy: 'Can you watch what?'

Dorothy: 'The video?
What do you want to watch?'

Dorothy: 'Pardon?'

Christopher: 'I haven't watched before.'

Dorothy: 'There isn't anything new, no.

Tim: 'Mum.'

Christopher: 'Why have you have you got it on?'

Dorothy: 'Well a man came earlier on today and he said please would we record conversations that we have all the time.
So you don't have to touch it, you just have to talk to me and just leave it sitting there.
It doesn't matter.'

Christopher: 'Why do you [UNK]?'

Tim: 'Mummy.'

Dorothy: 'Yes?'

Tim: 'Mummy.'

Dorothy: 'Mm.'

Tim: 'I'

Christopher: 'How does it test you on the jumper?'

Dorothy: 'It just picks up your voice.
You know like in church?'

Dorothy: 'You know when we go to church and you have a microphone on, and it makes your voice go round all the church?
Well it's a bit like that but instead of making it go round all the church it goes on to the tape.'

Christopher: 'This?'

Dorothy: 'So it records.
Yes.
There's there's a tape in my pocket look.'

Christopher: 'Where?'

Dorothy: 'In there.'

Christopher: 'Why do you have to let's have a look at it.'

Dorothy: 'We'll have a look at it later on.
Oh very, very tuneful Tim.'

Christopher: 'Why do you have to have it Why do you have to have it?'

Dorothy: 'Because there are some people that want to listen to what we say in our house, and what we say to each other.
And then they can think about language and how people use language.'

Tim: 'That's a funny sound.'

Christopher: 'What about in France?
Well if you can [UNK] in Fr'

Dorothy: 'In France?
No, it won't pick up our voices in France.
But in France if they did the same thing they would be talking in French down their machine.

Anyway, arrived at the station and there was this great coach standing there waiting to take them all to [UNK].
It was blocking the whole of the car park.
So this car that was trying to get out was sitting there waiting and there was no driver in sight and people were rushing about all over the station trying to find the driver.
Anyway it didn't worry us cos we were behind the coach.
But I did feel sorry for the man who was trying to get out cos he must have been in there for ages.
I suppose they thought that there wouldn't be anybody trying to get out cos the train'

Andrew: 'Mm.'

Dorothy: 'Have you got a story?'

Tim: 'Yeah upstairs.

That one about building the house?'

Tim: 'Yeah, like ours.'

Dorothy: 'Oh.'

Tim: 'It's a different one though cos this is a big one.'

Dorothy: 'Right.'

Tim: 'And that's not a big one in the story.'

Dorothy: 'How's that?'

Tim: 'House. [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'We need some more walls.'

Tim: '[UNK] some more walls.'

Dorothy: 'Oh that's a good one.
A big tall one.
Let's try that shall we?
Shall we put a roof on?'

That way do you think?'

Tim: '[UNK] the roof.
[UNK]. Have to do without the roof.
Have to do that to the'

Dorothy: 'Then we'll make it come down now this side.
Are you doing some more whoops a daisy.'

Tim: 'Whoops.'

Dorothy: 'If you're going to make it go out that way then you'll have to make it go out that way at the bottom otherwise it won't fit when you try to put the other wall up.'

Tim: 'Ooh.'

Dorothy: 'And the problem with that one is is it's not sort of fitting the edge there.'

Tim: 'It is.
Look.
Need one of these.'

Dorothy: 'Then this comes down the side look.'

Tim: 'Need one of these.'

Dorothy: 'Oh no, that's not right.
Look at that it's got things sticking out.
Do you think you've got to have it down the edge there, haven't you?
This time.
And how do we fix this on now?'

Tim: 'Look, I show you.
Er there'

Dorothy: 'And could we take this yellow one off we'll find it fits in like a wall, like that look.'

Tim: 'Oh!
[UNK] That goes on.'

Dorothy: '[UNK] try that.
That's good.
Oh.
Oops.'

Tim: 'Oh.
I'm gonna make it.'

Dorothy: 'There you are.
Now what are we gonna do with this yellow piece?'

Tim: 'I know [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Wonder if we can put that on the bottom, can't we somewhere?'

Tim: '[UNK] that be the floor.'

Dorothy: 'Yeah.
This doesn't feel quite right here somehow.
It's all wobbly.
Shall we, just let's see if we can turn this round so it makes it'

Tim: 'We need one of these.'

Dorothy: 'When Ellie did it it didn't seem to fall to pieces like ours is Timothy.'

Tim: 'That's it.'

Tim: 'We [UNK] the floor now.
Is it ready?'

Dorothy: 'Think the eggs probably are but I don't think the whole lunch is yet.
Are you hungry?'

Andrew: 'Is it possible to lay the table do you think, for me?'

Dorothy: 'I think we might manage that.'

Tim: 'It's ready.'

## 022201

Andrew: 'It's a bit different from [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'We don't usually have Edam do we?'

Christopher: 'Did I have it with my Marmite?'

Andrew: 'Yes, you've had it with your Marmite.
That much?
Is that alright?'

Tim: 'I want a bit of it.

Dorothy: 'He's got cream cheese on there dear.'

Andrew: 'Right.'

Christopher: 'I like it better with Marmite.
Can I have Marmite and cheese please?

Tim: 'Fold it over.'

Tim: 'You'

Christopher: 'What?'

Tim: '[UNK] Mum I finished my bit. [UNK]'

Christopher: 'Oh!'

Tim: 'I can't do it.
Why is there not very much left in?'

Christopher: 'Because I had it all when we had breakfast.
Anyway, we've had it a lot haven't we?'

Christopher: 'We've had Marmite a lot.
I had it for my dinner at school a lot actually.'

Andrew: 'Mm.
Mm. [UNK]'

Christopher: 'Dad [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Right, what's on the agenda for this afternoon then?'

Christopher: 'Dad, it's not all over.'

Tim: 'What's that?'

Tim: 'What's that?'

Tim: 'Mum, what's that?'

Dorothy: 'It looks like a sandwich going up and down to me.'

Tim: 'No.
It's a lid.
It's a lid.'

Dorothy: 'Oh.'

Andrew: 'What about you?
A rest I suppose.'

Dorothy: 'I dunno really.
My body feels inactive, but my mind feels fed up, [UNK].'

Andrew: '[UNK] [UNK] this week. [UNK]'

Christopher: 'Dad, I like the cheese better than the Marmite.'

Andrew: 'That's why I like Saturday's and'

Dorothy: 'Potter about.'

Andrew: 'Do the garden or walking or whatever it is.
Something very different.'

Tim: 'Why did you toast [UNK] bread? [UNK] toast.'

Andrew: 'No, there won't be any more now. [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'And that dozen in our garden can't decide which way to face.
Have you noticed?
Cos in the morning they get the sun from that direction, then they don't see the sun again for a bit and then it turns up suddenly from over there.
They don't know whether to face over there or over there.'

Christopher: 'Mum.'

Dorothy: 'Hello.'

Christopher: 'What and then we had a lot of biscuits.'

Dorothy: 'Did you?'

Christopher: 'Why?'

Dorothy: 'I don't know why.'

Christopher: '[UNK] talking about Monday.'

Tim: 'I know what it is.'

Christopher: 'What?'

Dorothy: 'Questions on Monday.'

Tim: 'I know what it is.'

Andrew: 'What is it?'

Andrew: 'You're right.
It is oranges.
They've been sitting there for over a week [UNK]'

Tim: '[UNK] I just see the orange. [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Well they were meant to go in a chicken but it never happened.'

Tim: 'It's oranges, I guessed it.'

Christopher: 'I knew [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'I was going to do chicken a l'orange.'

Christopher: 'It's my turn.'

Dorothy: 'But you weren't here so I thought ooh, blow this for a lark.'

Christopher: 'I can see black.'

Andrew: 'Oh.
Sorry for that.'

Christopher: 'No I don't know what that is.'

Tim: 'Red.'

Christopher: 'Yes.'

Tim: 'And that's black.'

Christopher: 'Red.'

Tim: 'I I guessed the oranges.'

Andrew: 'That's right.
Half each.'

Dorothy: 'Mm.
Good idea.'

Christopher: 'No, one each.
One each.'

Dorothy: 'One each?'

Andrew: 'No.
Too big.'

Dorothy: 'They're huge.'

Dorothy: 'We'll be having half each.'

Tim: 'Half!'

Dorothy: 'Mm.
Because they're rather large.
Do you want to peel them?'

Andrew: 'If you peel one I'll peel the other.'

Dorothy: 'Okay.'

Tim: 'If if you peel that one'

Dorothy: 'Mm?'

Tim: 'that's my friend mummy.'

Dorothy: 'Your friend am I?
That's nice.'

Andrew: 'Am I a friend too? [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'We're all friendly together.'

Tim: 'I'm I'm mummy's friend and daddy's friend and [UNK]'

Andrew: 'And you can share it up.'

Tim: 'And you share it up.'

Andrew: 'Yes.'

Tim: 'They both have [UNK].
Oh, [UNK] me.'

Christopher: 'Tim, put your hands over your eyes.'

Tim: 'No.'

Dorothy: 'Those satsumas we had or whatever they were clementines were they were quite nice for tea all this week.
Have you had one?'

Andrew: '[UNK] very difficult to peel.
One day I had them and they were full of pips.'

Dorothy: 'Oh.'

Andrew: 'Did you have that problem?'

Dorothy: 'Oh no we've never had that problem.'

Andrew: 'Mm.
Have you'

Christopher: 'I've had that problem.'

Andrew: 'With lots of pips in?
Mm.'

Dorothy: 'Did you have one at school with lots of pips in?'

Andrew: 'Mm.
Sorry about that.'

Dorothy: 'Oh.'

Andrew: 'You just couldn't tell from the outside.'

Dorothy: 'Beg your pardon.'

Andrew: 'I had that problem once.'

Christopher: 'I kept looking in mine when I when I had it once I thought ooh.
And now I'm going to have a look in my orange before I eat it.'

Dorothy: 'Very wise.'

Andrew: 'So I don't know whether this one will have pips in it, so be careful.'

Tim: 'Daddy.'

Dorothy: 'I would think the oranges will have pips in won't they?
Usually do.'

Andrew: 'Oh they usually do.'

Tim: 'I think these have pips in.'

Dorothy: 'Mm.
Orange pips are slightly bigger than satsuma pips so you can see them.'

Christopher: 'Yeah but sat the satsuma pip was really big.'

Andrew: 'They were quite big.'

Christopher: 'Actually I got it in my mouth.'

Andrew: 'Did you?'

Dorothy: 'That's alright.
You spit it out again did you?'

Christopher: 'Yeah.
Mum what's that hard thing?'

Tim: '[UNK] half.'

Christopher: '[UNK] everybody was eating'

Dorothy: 'Do other people get satsumas at school?'

Tim: '[UNK] half please.'

Christopher: 'No.'

Dorothy: 'Yeah.
No?
What do they have?'

Christopher: 'Half.'

Andrew: 'Sorry.'

Christopher: 'Dad give them into little bits.'

Dorothy: 'Just check there's no pips Tim.'

Andrew: 'Yeah.'

Christopher: 'And I'll check mine.'

Andrew: 'You're checking yours are you?'

Christopher: 'I'll check mine myself.
All I do is look in the [UNK]'

Tim: 'I think there's no pips in mine.'

Dorothy: 'Just as well innit?
Seeing's you've eaten it.
Whoops careful.'

Andrew: 'Slow down a bit.'

Dorothy: 'Just go slowly Tim.'

Andrew: 'Yes.'

Dorothy: 'Cos they're big slices, it's not like satsumas.'

Andrew: 'Chew them properly.'

Tim: '[UNK] [UNK] Daddy.'

Andrew: 'Yes.'

Tim: 'You you do this.'

Andrew: 'Mm.'

Tim: 'You you you do this [UNK] you you suck [UNK]'

Andrew: 'No I'm not suck it I just eat it.'

Tim: 'I rescued you [UNK]'

Christopher: 'Mrs [UNK] and Mrs [UNK] and Mrs [UNK] don't cut them properly.'

Dorothy: 'Don't they?'

Christopher: 'If I had an orange mum'

Dorothy: 'Mhm.'

Christopher: 'and they cut it all that [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'They leave the skin on?
You don't have to eat the skin, surely?'

Christopher: 'No, but all they do, they leave the orange in the skin.'

Andrew: 'Oh I see, they don't peel it.'

Dorothy: 'And you have to suck it out?
Oh.
That's probably cos it would take them too long to peel everybody's oranges wouldn't it?'

Christopher: 'There's no skin on yours.'

Tim: 'I think this one's got pips in.'

Dorothy: 'Oh.'

Andrew: 'They're nice aren't they?'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Dorothy: 'Do you have Mrs [UNK] and Mrs [UNK] then with your class? mm just Mrs [UNK].'

Christopher: 'No. [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Mm.'

Christopher: 'What we do'

Dorothy: 'Mm.'

Christopher: 'is we go to another class'

Dorothy: 'Mm.'

Christopher: 'and we [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Ah I see, right.

And yours is Mrs [UNK].
Theirs is Mrs [UNK].

Tim: 'It's got a pip in.'

Dorothy: 'Mm.
Well put it that bit then in there.'

Christopher: 'Mum, none of mine had pips in.'

Dorothy: 'And mine [UNK].

Andrew: 'Very nice.'

Christopher: 'Mum.'

Andrew: 'It's nicer than a satsuma really.'

Dorothy: 'It is.
Got more faff'

Christopher: 'What else is there?'

Dorothy: 'What else is there?'

Christopher: 'Mm.'

Andrew: 'I'll have a look and see what else there is.'

Dorothy: 'You might find some biscuits in the biscuit tin.'

Christopher: 'Is it biscuits again?'

Dorothy: 'Oh.

Dorothy: 'Mum [UNK] I didn't like [UNK] did I?

But I haven't had one once and it tasted really nice.'

Tim: 'Oh what we gonna have?
What we gonna have?
Er what we going to have mum?
What we gonna have dad?'

Dorothy: 'Cloth by the sound of the water.'

Christopher: 'What?'

Dorothy: 'We're going to have a cloth by the sound of the water.'

Tim: 'I think I [UNK].'

Andrew: 'Yeah I think daddy's just erm making sure we haven't got such sticky fingers after our oranges I think.
Then we'll have a biscuit.'

Dorothy: 'Can you pass me a cup please? [UNK]'

Christopher: '[UNK] I want to wash my hands first cos [UNK].'

Christopher: 'I'll have the next round.

Tim: 'Now.'

Christopher: 'Then daddy'

Dorothy: 'Thank you.'

Andrew: 'Yes?'

Christopher: 'You can keep this if you like.'

Andrew: 'Right, thank you.'

Christopher: 'You can have it if you want.'

Andrew: '[UNK] I've already washed my hands.'

Christopher: 'Oh.'

Dorothy: 'Where's he going?
Toilet?'

Dorothy: 'He's only had three drinks. [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'You definitely pay the penalty don't you, for leaving your children?
Cos other people say you don't do things your way.
It must be a problem if people sort of leave their children in nurseries all the time cos it's nice for a short time but for a long long time they're just not yours are they any more?
Yeah.
It seems a pity but it's not for very long.'

Andrew: 'He's been chucked out a lot recently hasn't he?'

Dorothy: 'He has yeah.
That's why I'm feeling as if I ought to stay in tonight really.
What do you think?
Think I'm just chickening out?'

Andrew: 'I think it's a bit of both.'

Dorothy: 'I am chickening out cos I don't feel as if I've learnt an awful lot.'

Andrew: 'Yeah.'

Dorothy: 'Well do you want to chicken out?
Instead.'

Andrew: 'I think I ought to go.'

Dorothy: 'Why?'

Andrew: 'I ought to go.'

Dorothy: 'Why?'

Dorothy: 'You've said you'll go.
Just because you've said you'll go or because you think [UNK]?'

Andrew: 'I think [UNK]'

Andrew: '[UNK] possibly.
Even though I have heard it all before.'

Dorothy: 'And do you think I ought to go then?
Well I mean there might well be something'

Andrew: 'I don't mind.
Well there might be.
But I can understand'

Dorothy: 'gripping and of interest but at the same time my priorities at this moment'

Tim: '[UNK] got a pip in.

Dorothy: 'It doesn't seem very fair.'

Andrew: 'Fair on who?'

Dorothy: 'Him.'

Tim: 'Oh here.'

Dorothy: 'You alright?

Andrew: 'Considering everything put together like your tiredness your children'

Dorothy: 'Mm.'

Andrew: 'not a tremendous amount new [UNK] just to get there [UNK] [UNK]'

Tim: 'Oh!'

Dorothy: 'It is with this one.

Dorothy: 'That's true.'

Tim: 'I get [UNK] a biscuit.'

Dorothy: 'Why, what happened yesterday?'

Christopher: 'Because that girl came.'

Dorothy: 'Oh yes, she gave you a lolly didn't she?

Christopher: 'A lolly?'

Oh here comes dad.'

Christopher: 'Hello hello hello hello hello hello.

Hello hello hello what are you do.

Dorothy: 'I don't know really.

I don't know why.
You don't have to say it twice if you don't want to.
You can just read this bit if you like.'

Christopher: 'It might be that one.'

Dorothy: 'I thought it would be that one cos you'd be a bit wobbly wouldn't you with your sawing?
Or were you straight with your sawing?'

Christopher: 'Straight but mum we had a very straight thing which sta stood on the table very hardly and [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Right.

Christopher: 'If it doesn't mum anyway it wouldn't fit in the garage because there's another car in there.'

Dorothy: 'Oh that's a point.
That's a bit tricky.
Well we think that that might be a new car.'

Andrew: 'Yeah, we think it's [UNK]'

Andrew: 'Well you could.
It would be a little bit far for us.
But we could if we needed to.'

Dorothy: 'Wouldn't be too bad cos you'd go down by the Jolly Farmer.'

Andrew: 'Yeah.'

Dorothy: 'You'd have to walk like Gemma walks to school wouldn't you?'

Christopher: 'Mm.'

Andrew: 'Where does Gemma live?'

Dorothy: 'Gemma lives Oakenshaw'

Christopher: 'Yeah, near MacDonalds.
Near MacDonalds dad.
She lives right near MacDonalds doesn't she?'

Dorothy: 'She does actually.
Wonder if she goes to MacDonalds every night for her tea?'

Christopher: 'No.
But she could walk it from her house couldn't she?'

Dorothy: 'She could.'

Christopher: 'Because it's not far.
Yeah all she has to do is go go round her bit round just a normal road, across the road down a little bit and she's there.'

It's'

Christopher: 'What?'

Andrew: 'it's a bit full.'

Dorothy: 'Oh it looks crowded.
Perhaps there's a party.'

Tim: 'It's not a party.'

Christopher: 'Perhaps there's only one person in each car at MacDonalds.'

Dorothy: 'That's true.
I can't think that one person in a car on their own would want to go to MacDonalds too often.'

Christopher: 'Like a mum or a dad or [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Everybody must have thought what a dismal day this is.'

Andrew: 'Mm.'

Dorothy: 'Let's got to MacDonalds for our tea.
Mm it is quite full though.'

Dorothy: 'I bet she would, she loves anything like that!
Bit of a body!
Mind you, it might be too complicated!'

Andrew: 'It was I remember reading in the paper that it's been it's been filmed at a house which no one's ever been allowed to go in even the great sort of one of these country mansions, it was not Bradley Hall'

Dorothy: 'Mm.'

Andrew: 'It's as you come off the [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'And how did'

Andrew: 'and'

Andrew: 'They somehow managed to persuade the owners, apparently it was [UNK] and it was and nobody else had ever been allowed in this place not even erm historians who write about famous buildings, even they had been refused access!'

Dorothy: 'Where is it?'

Andrew: 'Somewhere in Oxfordshire.'

Dorothy: 'Oh!
They don't know where?'

Dorothy: 'Oh [UNK].
So'

Dorothy: 'this was about last week's episode?'

Andrew: 'I think it was about last week's epi, but they seem to e imply that it was last week's episode that would'

Dorothy: 'Oh.'

Andrew: 'do it.'

Dorothy: 'We seem to have got one spare video if we don't get it watched before Wednesday.'

Andrew: 'Alright.
Well that's the only chance.'

Dorothy: 'Oh yeah cos we're going to Maryland tomorrow.
[UNK] your dad.'

Andrew: 'Mm.'

Dorothy: 'Erm not it wasn't about your dad, it was about my birthday cos'

So I said send me a cheque and I'll go and shop.'

Andrew: 'And?'

Dorothy: 'And [UNK] last week cos she's quite generous isn't she?'

Andrew: 'She is a bit but it's [UNK].'

Dorothy: 'No, I didn't say anything.'

Andrew: 'I think that's the thing.'

Dorothy: 'So your dad sent a cheque.
Anyway I asked her if she'd heard from your dad, and she has heard from your dad apparently on Friday he went to the consultant'

Andrew: 'Mm.'

Dorothy: 'and next week he's got his first well she didn't know whether it was radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
And she said he has to go trotting to Exeter two or three times a week now.'

Andrew: 'Mm.'

Dorothy: 'I don't know how long it's going to go on for, or what it is exactly but I thought it would be a good idea to ring your dad up and see.'

Andrew: 'Mm.'

Dorothy: '[UNK] But at least things have moved, and at least they've gone round.
So I'm pleased really, are you?
Interesting that they've done it so quickly isn't it?
After seeing him, because he thought that once he'd seen the consultant it would then take some time to get the treatment started, but they must have got themselves over that.'

Andrew: 'Yeah.
Well I mean everyone [UNK].'

Dorothy: 'Yeah.'

Andrew: 'I think [UNK].'

Dorothy: 'Gotta get moving.'

Dorothy: 'And presumably whatever it was the GP had give him has had tha, upset that thrombosis again.
I don't know whether to ring him tonight, oh it's too late tonight now.'

Andrew: 'It's much too late.'

Dorothy: 'Perhaps we could ring tomorrow afternoon when the children are up?
Well they love talking to them on the phone don't they?'

Andrew: 'I know they do.'

Dorothy: 'We could can prime them up on what to say and types of things to talk about so they don't get moaned down or something [UNK]!
Bogged down [UNK]!'

Andrew: 'So he's had to go in, what did you say?
Three times a week?'

Dorothy: 'I don't know she just said'

Andrew: 'Something like that'

Dorothy: 'a few times a week and I think it sounded like three cos she was wondering how he would cope with driving and everything.'

Andrew: 'Mm a trial!'

Dorothy: 'Well I hope not I mean no he won't be able to drive'

Dorothy: 'but presumably your mum can do that for, they've got hundreds of people there, he's always driving people everywhere'

Andrew: 'That's right.'

Dorothy: 'so I don't see why they can't drive him!
I'm sure they will'

Andrew: 'Yes.'

Dorothy: 'cos they're very good aren't they?
I mean look at that woman doing her er [UNK] from the from the church.'

Andrew: 'At times like this it would be nice if we lived nearer could help out.'

Dorothy: 'It would nice if we lived there but we can't so [UNK]'

Andrew: 'It's about [UNK].'

Dorothy: 'And write as well.'

Andrew: 'Yes.'

Dorothy: 'Double dose.'

Andrew: 'Yes.
And pulled out.'

Dorothy: 'Well it's sort of pulled out, but at least it's [UNK].'

Andrew: 'We'll be paying for it as well.'

Dorothy: 'And it's hard as well.'

Dorothy: 'We've been paying anyway, so it must of you know.
What does erm you see er Eileen's [UNK] and she's having chemotherapy isn't she?
By me, by medication, is'

Dorothy: 'that right?'

Andrew: 'Well she takes all these tablet things.'

Dorothy: 'That's right she has a sort of massive dose every now and then.
And that makes her feel what?
She's not in pain [UNK] is she?
More sort of dopey.'

Andrew: 'I wouldn't care if they made me dazed [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Yeah.'

Andrew: '[UNK]!'

Dorothy: 'Yeah.
I dunno.'

Andrew: 'Not gonna [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Difficult to know.'

Dorothy: 'Oh yes, that was it!
I wonder how bad it is, that feeling's like, we don't really know how bad it is do we?'

Andrew: 'No.'

Dorothy: 'Perhaps he will be able to say, you know?
But whether he'd tell us over the telephone, [UNK] you think ask.
I think he would wouldn't he?'

Andrew: 'I think so.'

Andrew: 'Yeah.'

Dorothy: 'Cos I thought it wasn't very fair to lend out the children's stuff'

Dorothy: 'Sometimes in dreams everything goes most peculiar doesn't it?'

Tim: 'But it wasn't very sad.'

Dorothy: 'No, it was a pleasant dream.
Sometimes dreams are quite pleasant, you think, ooh I like that dream, I'd like that one again.
It never quite works out like that.'

Christopher: 'No because you forget it in the end'

Dorothy: 'Oh yeah'

Christopher: 'lots of dreams like that.'

Do you remember?
You were very frightened, we had to get you up read you a story have a cuddle put the light on.'

Christopher: 'I couldn't remember when, I don't think.'

Dorothy: 'It was something like half past two in the morning!
Anyway it didn't matter cos you were very good, and you went back to sleep again in the end then you didn't wake up till after daddy had gone to work this morning!'

Christopher: 'No because then, I just looked over all those things that I went and [UNK].'

Dorothy: 'Oh right.'

Christopher: 'And then, I knocked at the [UNK] very weak leg.'

Dorothy: 'Aha.'

Christopher: 'And when I looked at the clock, I was on time and [UNK].'

One day Pegs was going out.
You can play in the garden while I'm away she said.

Dorothy: 'Mhm.'

Christopher: 'Mum, to do a seven you have to go across and then down.'

Dorothy: 'You do, you're right.'

Tim: 'Mummy.'

Christopher: 'And then up.'

Dorothy: 'Tim looked at his sister.
She was fast asleep.'

Christopher: 'I used to do it that way [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Tim jumped on her to wake her up but she only said go away, and went back to sleep again.
What does this bit say?
Do you remember?'

Tim: 'Tim er'

Dorothy: 'Jumped.'

Tim: 'Tim jumped.'

Dorothy: 'That one bit says Tim and that bit there says jumped.
Tim jumped.'

Christopher: 'That's five isn't it?'

Dorothy: 'Yes.
Whoops, we've missed, I lost our page there [UNK].
Tim got out of the hole.
The sun was shining and the sky was blue.
Tim went out into the garden.'

Dorothy: 'Hold on.
You've got to say this bit first.'

Tim: 'Tim went out.'

Dorothy: 'Very good.
That was a bit clever.'

Christopher: 'Is that all done?
Are they all done now?'

Dorothy: 'Tim saw a tree well er they look all done to me.'

Tim: 'Tim saw a tree.'

Dorothy: 'That's right.
The tree was growing near the house.'

Tim: 'He's gonna go up there in the [UNK] the house.'

Dorothy: 'Do you want to try that one?'

Dorothy: 'It's a bit like what we've been doing before where you've got to look at the money.
It said how much for both?
Tick the money you will need.
You have to tick off.
It's going to be nine p and one p.
That makes ten p altogether and you have to tick off the ten pence by doing a five and a five.
So you have to add this bit up first.'

Tim: 'Mummy.'

Dorothy: 'Three p and five p and write down what it comes to.
What will that be?'

Christopher: 'So you have to tick that one off?'

Dorothy: 'Wait a minute.
Well find that first of all.
Three p and five p makes?'

Tim: 'Read it.'

Dorothy: 'Jus can I just show Christopher what to do with this page?
Cos once he's got going he can get on with it himself then.'

Christopher: 'Eight.'

Dorothy: 'That's right.
So put your eight p down there.
And then you have to work out the coins that you'll need for eight p'

Tim: 'Mummy.'

Dorothy: 'or three p and five p.'

Tim: 'Mummy.
Mummy.'

Dorothy: 'So which ones will you need?
Just tick them off, the bits that you'll need.'

Tim: 'Tim went ran up the tree.'

Christopher: 'Erm'

Dorothy: 'Nearly.
Tim ran to the tree.'

Tim: 'Ran to to the tree.'

Christopher: 'Will I need two and two and one?'

Dorothy: 'Will you need what love?'

Christopher: 'Two two and one.'

Dorothy: 'Two two and one.
That would make five.
And then you need another three.
Why don't you have the fi look for the three p first and tick that off and then look for the five p next and tick that off.'

Christopher: 'Tick five p off?
Tick five p off.'

Tim: 'I don't know this bit.'

Dorothy: 'Mm.
Cos you know that five p and three p are gonna make eight p don't you?'

Tim: 'Mummy mum.

Christopher: 'You still can't see it.'

Dorothy: 'Well make a big tick sticking out like there's does.
That's it, now [UNK] That's it there, now what else makes eight p?'

Tim: 'Mummy.'

Dorothy: 'Tim climbed to the very top of the tree.
He looked down and saw the house.
The roof of the house was very close to the top of the tree.'

Christopher: 'Three.'

Tim: 'Tim'

Christopher: 'You haven't got a three p.'

Dorothy: 'Looked'

Tim: 'looked'

Christopher: 'Well!
We have to do this.
Tick that one.'

Dorothy: 'Down.'

Tim: 'down.'

Dorothy: 'That's it.
Tim looked down.'

Christopher: 'And tick that one.'

Dorothy: 'You've got four p there.
Do you know what you're doing on that that that's for that one.
You're up here.
Mm.'

Tim: 'Mummy Tim ran'

Dorothy: 'You've ticked the wrong things but it doesn't matter cos we can probably use those anyway.'

Tim: 'Tim'

Tim: 'climbed Tim climbed up there.'

Dorothy: 'It's a good try.
It actually says Tim saw the window.
Tim jumped on to the roof of the house.
There was a window in the roof.
Tim saw the window.
The window was open.'

Tim: 'Tim'

Dorothy: 'Saw'

Tim: 'saw'

Christopher: 'Three three p.'

Dorothy: 'the'

Tim: 'the'

Dorothy: 'window.'

Christopher: 'Three p mum.
Three p.'

Dorothy: 'That's it.
That's it.
Well done.
Now you have to do this one.
Tricky aren't they, these?
Tim ran up the roof to the window.
He looked down into the room below.
He saw an old man sitting in a chair.
The old man had long white hair and a white beard.
He must be a magician'

Christopher: 'Mum nine.'

Dorothy: 'Tim said to himself.'

Tim: 'Magician.'

Dorothy: 'That's it.
The magician.
Well done.'

Christopher: 'Nine there.'

Dorothy: 'Mhm.'

Tim: 'He's going in.'

Dorothy: 'The magician was fast asleep.
Tim leaned over to have a good look at him, but his foot slipped and he fell in.
He landed right on the magician's knee.
Tim dug in his claws and held on.'

Tim: 'Tim fell in.'

Dorothy: 'Well done.
The magician woke up with a yell of pain.
He saw Tim standing on his knee.
Where on earth did you come from?
He asked.
I fell in said Tim.
Then you'd better fall out again said the magician.
Take your claws out of my knee and go away.'

Tim: 'Tim'

Dorothy: 'The'

Tim: 'the magician'

Dorothy: 'woke'

Tim: 'up.'

Dorothy: 'That's it.'

Christopher: '[UNK] five [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Tim pulled out his claws.
He looked up at the'

Christopher: 'Four.'

Dorothy: 'window.
I can't get up there by myself he said.'

Tim: 'Tim'

Dorothy: 'Looked'

Christopher: 'Look mummy.'

Tim: 'looked'

Christopher: 'Look.'

Dorothy: 'up'

Tim: 'at up.'

Christopher: 'That's it.'

Dorothy: 'It is it.
You're right.
We'll soon see about that said the magician.
One two three and you're back'

Christopher: 'Six p in there.'

Dorothy: 'in the tree.
And he snapped his fingers.'

Christopher: 'Isn't it six?'

Dorothy: 'This one says one two three.'

Tim: 'Two three.'

Dorothy: 'That's it.'

Christopher: 'Tick.'

Dorothy: 'That's it.
Very good.
Tim felt himself flying up in the air.
A moment later he found himself back in the top of the tree.'

Christopher: 'Nine.'

Dorothy: 'And'

Christopher: 'Nine is here.'

Dorothy: 'Yeah.
And'

Tim: 'Tim'

Dorothy: 'was in the'

Tim: 'tree.'

Dorothy: 'Very good.
You're good at this book aren't you Tim?
Tim climbed down the tree just as Pegs came back into the garden.
Tim ran to ni to meet her.
Tim cried Pegs.
Where have you been?'

Tim: 'Tim'

Dorothy: 'Ran.'

Tim: 'ran home.'

Dorothy: 'Well it should say Tim ran home.
It doesn't, it just says Tim ran.
It would make more sense if it said Tim ran home.'

Tim: 'Tim been to the magician.'

Dorothy: 'He has.
I've been to see the magician said Tim.
It was very exciting.
I expect it was said Pegs but you better be careful Tim.
Magicians can work magic.
I know they can said Tim.
The magician did work magic.
I flew up into the tree.
It was very exciting but I shall be very careful next time.'

Tim: 'Tim and Pegs.'

Dorothy: 'That's it.'

Tim: 'Tim on the pegs.'

Dorothy: 'Tim and Pegs.
It's cos they're both on the picture.
And that's the end of the book.
You were very good at that weren't you?'

Christopher: 'Oh.
Another nine.'

Dorothy: 'Oh good gracious.
Two nines.
Oh that's'

Christopher: 'Look.'

Dorothy: 'easy then.
You'll be able to use the same coins.'

Christopher: 'Two five.'

Dorothy: 'That's only seven.'

Tim: 'Mum.'

Christopher: 'What?'

Tim: 'Mummy.'

Dorothy: 'Two and five is only seven.
You need another two.
That's it.'

Christopher: 'Mum.'

Dorothy: 'Mm.'

Christopher: '[UNK] to do lots more.'

Dorothy: 'You don't have to.
If you want to you can give up now and we'll do some reading next.
Do you want to have a go at My Mum's a Window Cleaner?
And then after that we'll go in the garden.'

Christopher: 'What?'

Dorothy: 'I said after that we'll go in the garden before it rains.'

Dorothy: 'We'll also have to ring grandma and tell her that we won't be coming to her house today cos we won't be going swimming.
Cos although you're much better now'

Tim: 'Mum I want to read this.'

Dorothy: 'I don't think you should be going to erm I don't think we'll read another one just right this minute lovey.

Tim: 'It's a different one.'

Dorothy: 'now.

Christopher: 'I feel really better.'

Dorothy: 'You feel really better?

Tim: 'He going swimming?'

Dorothy: 'He's not going swimming, no.

Christopher: 'Mum, will we play school instead?'

Dorothy: 'Yeah.

Christopher: 'And after this will we [UNK] play schools?'

Christopher: 'You have to be careful when you walk under her legs'

Dorothy: 'Ladder.'

Some people say it's unlucky to walk under ladders.
I think it's a lot of rubbish.'

Christopher: 'Unlucky?'

Dorothy: 'Mm.'

Christopher: 'What does that mean?'

Dorothy: 'Well there you are.
That's why it would be unlucky, cos she'll drop water all over you.'

Christopher: 'Do you think it's unlucky?'

Dorothy: 'No I don't.
I think it's silly to say that.'

Christopher: 'Because if it's silly'

Tim: 'I want to read this one now.'

Dorothy: 'Did you enjoy that one Tim?
Did you think that was good?'

Christopher: 'It wasn't really a washing one.'

Dorothy: 'No we thought it was a window cleaning book.
It's really a fire engine book.'

Christopher: 'A fire engine what?'

Andrew: 'Good.
When did everybody get up?'

Christopher: 'Mum could you cut my meat?'

Dorothy: 'They all sort of surfaced'

Andrew: 'You were all asleep when I er'

Dorothy: 'I think I'd had I finished my breakfast when, no I think you just came just as I was about to take my first mouthful of cereal.
It was about quarter to eight before everybody, well after that'

Christopher: 'No but it wasn't.'

Dorothy: 'What time did you get up?
What time did you go?'

Andrew: 'I left at twenty to eight.'

Dorothy: 'Mm.
It was about ten to eight when Christopher got up.
But Tim was still asleep till about quarter past eight.'

Andrew: 'Oh.'

Tim: 'And I shouted for daddy.'

Andrew: 'Did you?'

Dorothy: 'Which is unheard of.
Yes you did shout for daddy.'

Andrew: 'You shouted for daddy?
I was already at work.'

Dorothy: 'There was no daddy.
He'd gone to work already.
So then we had a bit of a wonder whether or not Christopher should go to school.
And I decided he was, should stay at home.'

Andrew: 'It's probably just as well cos'

Dorothy: 'Mm.'

Andrew: 'pool his strength for tomorrow.'

Dorothy: 'He was a bit sort of wobbly on his legs at the beginning of the day but he's been'

Christopher: 'Yeah.'

Dorothy: 'fine since.'

Andrew: 'And Tim's going to'

Dorothy: 'Nursery.'

Andrew: 'Holly Cottage tomorrow.
Aren't you?'

Tim: 'Ow.
Where [UNK] Look I found a yellow [UNK].'

Dorothy: 'We did go down to the library.
Cos I thought it would, it was such a warm day I thought it would be quite nice for him to have a walk see if he was alright.
Anyway managed to walk to the library and walk down the shops [UNK].
But when we got back we had to lie down in front of the video for a bit.'

Tim: 'Mum [UNK]'

Christopher: 'Mum, can I [UNK] for a minute please.'

Dorothy: 'Mhm.'

Andrew: 'So you just did your own private trip to the library [UNK]?'

Dorothy: 'Yeah I rang up and said I wasn't gonna go [UNK] the children.
Anyway it turned out we met Ann and erm both Martin and Ian are been having a similar trauma.'

Andrew: 'Have they?'

Dorothy: 'Mm.'

Andrew: 'Oh.'

Dorothy: 'Ian's been sort of talking about all sorts of strange things in his sleep and'

Andrew: 'Really?'

Dorothy: 'delirious and hot hot'

Andrew: 'Yes.'

Dorothy: '[UNK] fever.
So'

Andrew: 'It's odd.
A bug they're passing around.'

Dorothy: 'Mm.
Must be.'

Andrew: 'Child to child.'

Dorothy: 'And she said Martin was hot but nothing too traumatic.
A bit like these two really.'

Andrew: 'Mm.'

Dorothy: 'But Ian had been sick as well.'

Andrew: 'So it's likely they picked it up from them.'

Dorothy: 'I should think so.
Although Christopher didn't really see much of them did he?
Oh he did on Thursday didn't he?'

Andrew: 'Mm.'

Dorothy: 'I would have thought Tim would have had it worse from contact erm wise.
These things don't work like that do they?'

Andrew: 'No.
And is the parentage alright?'

Dorothy: 'Mm.'

Andrew: 'Only strikes children.'

Dorothy: 'Yeah.
Well it certainly did in both these cases.
Although I met Theresa on the way back from erm school and she said Alec was at the doctors cos not the way back from school, way back from the library.
And she said Alec was at the doctors cos he was feeling under the weather.'

Andrew: 'Yeah.'

Dorothy: 'So I don't know what that's in aid of.'

Andrew: 'Julia [UNK] ill so she'

Dorothy: 'Was she?'

Andrew: 'won't be at work tomorrow.'

Dorothy: 'Oh dear.
What's the matter with her?'

Tim: 'I don't want the meat.'

Dorothy: 'What's the matter with her?'

Andrew: 'Sore throat.'

Tim: 'I don't want the meat.'

Dorothy: 'You don't want the meat?'

Tim: 'No.'

Dorothy: 'You usually like meat.'

Andrew: 'It probably needs chopping up.'

Dorothy: 'Mm.
Let's chop it for you.'

Tim: 'No I don't want it chopped.'

Dorothy: 'Tim listen.
I'm going to chop you'

Tim: 'I don't want'

Dorothy: 'I'm going to chop you one piece of meat okay?
We'll take away the other piece.'

Tim: 'A big pieces.'

Dorothy: 'Yeah.
There you go.
It'll be nice now.
Nice and tasty.
Well done Christopher.'

Andrew: 'Mm.'

Dorothy: 'You alright?'

Andrew: 'Must be getting better.
So, it's been a nice warm day has it?'

Dorothy: 'Well it has really.
It's been a bit sort of muggy this afternoon but we went out in the garden and we sort of just pottled around you know?'

Andrew: 'Better than the weekend weather that I saw?'

Dorothy: 'Yeah.'

Andrew: 'It's amazing how the worst weather we've had recently has been on Saturdays and Sundays isn't it?'

Dorothy: 'Mm.
It's certainly very wet out there.'

Tim: 'We had a go on the swing.'

Andrew: 'Did you?
You've been on the swing?'

Dorothy: 'Apart from her sore throat was Julie okay?'

Andrew: 'Seemed alright.'

Tim: 'I [UNK] wobbly.'

Dorothy: 'Mm?'

Andrew: 'Yeah.
No it was a fairly quiet day really.
Not many people seemed to be at work.'

Dorothy: 'Oh.
Where are they all?'

Andrew: 'Some at meetings [UNK].
Like you know all'

Tim: 'Yeah'

Andrew: 'the people who went to Pontepool last week?
Well they're all off in Bromsgrove this week [UNK].'

Tim: 'Potato.'

Dorothy: 'Mm.'

Andrew: '[UNK] and big Patrick and Sue [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Oh yeah, in Bromsgrove yeah.
Mm.
What do they do?'

Dorothy: 'Mm.'

Tim: 'You gave me lots.'

Dorothy: 'I did not.'

Tim: 'You did.'

Dorothy: 'I certainly didn't give you lots of meat.'

Tim: 'I'm full.'

Dorothy: 'Oh that's alright.
You don't need to have anything else.'

Tim: 'I want my pudding.'

Dorothy: 'Oh no.
If you're full you won't need pudding.'

Andrew: 'No it'll be a tiny pudding if you're not gonna eat er finish all that.'

Tim: 'It's too much.'

Dorothy: 'Well that's okay.
You can leave it but you just don't get pudding as well.'

Andrew: 'You eat just a little bit more.
Cos then you can have a little pudding.
That's it, you eat just a little bit more.'

Andrew: 'That's very tasty mummy.
[UNK] Certainly looks as though it's a Rosemary Conley type thing.'

Tim: '[UNK] eat it.
You help me [UNK] meat.'

Andrew: 'Whoops, it's in your eye.'

Tim: 'Oh.
Oh.'

Tim: 'Potato.'

Andrew: 'Potato in your eye.'

Dorothy: 'Getting potatoes in your eyes.'

Dorothy: 'That's a funny place to put potato.
Mm broccoli doesn't want to come on the fork.
Come here broccoli.'

Tim: 'Broccoli can't get on fork very well can it?'

Dorothy: 'We rang grandma of course to say we wouldn't be swimming.'

Andrew: 'So she's at home alright is she?'

Dorothy: 'There's a lot of things we're not doing isn't there at the moment?'

Andrew: 'Mm.'

Dorothy: 'Yes.
She's fine.'

Christopher: 'And there are a lot of things we are doing.'

Andrew: 'I was telling you about the Queen Mary.
Because it was on the back of something which he was making recently.
You know he was cutting out some card'

Dorothy: 'Mm.
He showed me what it was.
But I couldn't tell that it was the Queen Mary at the time because he'd already cut it out.'

Andrew: 'and I was saying that it's a big boat that used to go across the world.
And when I was a little boy just a little bit bigger than Christopher I was shown round it with granny and grandpa and Uncle Michael and Uncle David.'

Tim: 'Cos I finished all my dinner'

Dorothy: 'You did finish all your dinner in the end didn't you after moaning on.'

Andrew: 'The Saturday before that none of us had it cos we were at granny and grandpa's.'

Andrew: 'Did it?'

Dorothy: 'you know trying to find an assistant cos there wasn't one walking about cos there was some at the tills but there weren't any walking around and it was very busy, there were lots of people going through the tills.
So anyway this girl eventually she said she was, it was her coffee break but she would come er in passing and sort us out.'

Tim: 'But mummy mummy.'

Dorothy: 'So she came down, it was so embarrassing.'

Tim: 'Mummy.'

Dorothy: 'I explained about the Rice Crispies she said ah'

Tim: 'Mummy.'

Dorothy: 'I think there must be some in here.
There was another great big box but instead of being up high it was down below and I could easily'

Christopher: 'Mummy dropped it when she was giving it to me.'

Christopher: 'And then we had to pick it up and put it near Cider and Cider ate it.'

Christopher: 'Is the week after a Monday?'

Dorothy: 'Mm.
I presume so.'

Andrew: 'Why is not on a [UNK]?'

Dorothy: 'Well they didn't tell us why.
Just said it wasn't.
I think they're just a bit shortstaffed because the girl that's usually in there hasn't been in there for weeks, Josie.
They've had the girl that's normally in there on a Saturday during the week.
Perhaps she's ill.'

Christopher: 'What did you say?
What did you say mother?'

Dorothy: 'I said there's normally a different lady in the in the library.'

Christopher: 'For what?'

Dorothy: 'On a Monday.
The lady that was in there today not Rosie the one that does the stories, she's always there well, when she's there.
The other lady, Josie, she's normally in there.
But she hasn't been there for a few weeks now so I think she might be ill.
Or on holiday or something.
No she can't be on holiday all that length of time.'

Christopher: 'She's back now.'

Dorothy: 'No she wasn't today.
There was a lady there but that's the lady that normally goes on a Saturday.'

Christopher: 'But why didn't she go on a Saturday then?'

Dorothy: 'Well I suppose she does go on a Saturday as well.
They probably had to rake her in to hold the fort.'

Christopher: 'I expect she didn't go [UNK].'

Dorothy: 'I don't know.'

Christopher: 'Why?'

Dorothy: 'I don't know whether she did or not.'

Because er it's marvellous what they've been able to do.
It's not quite finished.'

Dorothy: 'I expect it was packed was it?'

Marjorie: 'It was full [UNK].
And er the thing was, we found out afterwards why they'd done it.
The organ pipes are in the middle of the chancel and you couldn't see the east window at the [UNK].'

Dorothy: 'No.'

Marjorie: 'Oh well they said that's because they'd not got that section finished'

Dorothy: 'Knew where to get extra'

Marjorie: 'Yeah.'

Dorothy: 'Because he's known the right people.'

Marjorie: 'but they've gotta let him.
You see.'

Dorothy: 'Mm.'

Marjorie: 'But he, he said to the insurance people no I don't want you just to keep on paying the bills.'

Dorothy: 'Yeah.'

Marjorie: 'He said we'll have a lump sum.
And he got the lump sum and they was investing it and just drawing out when he needed it.'

Dorothy: 'That's it.'

Marjorie: 'Course it was very nice and we got a proper dinner at this erm mind you we were absolutely famished by the time we got there.

Now you've come early he said, have a sit there he said and you'll see everything.'

[UNK]: 'Is he happier?'

Dorothy: 'Tim you mean?'

[UNK]: 'No, that [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Oh that one'

Dorothy: 'Yes.
I tell you something I was amazed at erm the reading book he appeared with, Fluff and Nip and goodness knows what that went out with the ark when I came out of college, I don't know whether they're all reading that or whether it's just sort of found them and must of been just perhaps a one off or something, but, I was amazed'

Dorothy: 'no I don't think it is, I think it's probably got'

Dorothy: 'yeah'

Dorothy: 'it's the moral, that's right, and the moral sounds, sounds good doesn't it, I don't know if it is, but it just sounds it I suppose'

[UNK]: 'Well I, I mean [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'I mean I like [UNK] very much'

Dorothy: 'yeah'

Dorothy: 'yeah, could well be, I don't know what it is'

[UNK]: 'Yeah'

Dorothy: 'well I was worked to death'

[UNK]: 'if she [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'when I first came out of college and I really appreciated it'

[UNK]: 'well I, I, I'

Dorothy: 'you know you had high standards and you knew where you were aiming for and that's what I want my kids to go through as well, you know, somebody who's gonna do their best'

[UNK]: 'because it rubs off on them'

Dorothy: 'mm'

[UNK]: 'it's, it's everybody around them got to try hard'

Dorothy: 'that's right, that's right'

[UNK]: 'you know the stuff I mean they will'

Dorothy: 'yeah'

[UNK]: 'know that's there expect'

Dorothy: 'that's right and you know that if the staff has put theirselves out to make a decent crash in their environment they're gonna go mad at the children if they muck it up, so therefore, you know, you're gonna have that'

Dorothy: 'yeah'

[UNK]: 'I think that one of the things that get me at the moment is the time keeping, it's very bad'

Dorothy: 'mm'

[UNK]: 'I mean they stroll in at quarter to nine and I think'

Dorothy: 'right, right'

[UNK]: 'I think that'

Dorothy: 'it's a bit bad that'

[UNK]: 'yeah'

Dorothy: 'yeah, well I was there the other day and erm the bell went and nobody sort of moved and I thought I think, I know, you know, so I got up and I washed me cup of tea like, you know, they looked at me as if you know oh there's a keen [UNK], but I mean I do think it's important to do that, because not only that it's not fair for the'

[UNK]: 'I think [UNK] the day you get [UNK] I've, I've [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'dinner ladies, because I mean they're stuck out there you know doing their best.'

[UNK]: 'cos [UNK] from their every angle a child needs [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'yeah'

[UNK]: 'yeah, I was thinking of the parent and teacher side of it'

Dorothy: 'oh yeah'

Dorothy: 'yeah'

[UNK]: 'you're waiting to go into assembly'

Dorothy: 'yeah'

[UNK]: 'I don't know, it should, to me [UNK] every day, one, two children you know'

Dorothy: 'yep'

[UNK]: 'I think [UNK] they're late every day'

Dorothy: 'yeah'

[UNK]: 'once or twice [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'they probably don't get up until quarter to nine, see they have a struggle really to get there on time'

[UNK]: 'I, I, if you can manage to get here for ten past nine every day, why can't you manage to get here for nine o'clock'

Dorothy: 'to get here for nine o'clock every day, yeah'

Dorothy: 'it's five to it says on the bits of paper'

[UNK]: 'it's five to [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'but then the bell doesn't go till nine, although sometimes it goes at two minutes to nine and sometimes it goes at five past nine'

[UNK]: 'I think all the clocks are [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'they say something different or something do they?'

[UNK]: 'yeah, because I was in the [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'yeah'

Dorothy: 'we'll be sitting in the playground for ages, well standing in the playground for ages.'

[UNK]: 'I think sometimes these things crop up [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Yeah'

[UNK]: 'and we all get rather engrossed'

Tim: 'No.'

Dorothy: '[UNK] going to have Weetabix as well?'

Tim: 'Yeah.'

Andrew: '[UNK] she'll never manage all that.'

Dorothy: '[UNK] in that case you can't cope all all that.

Dorothy: 'There isn't any in there yet.

Tim: 'There.'

Dorothy: 'Ooh.'

Tim: 'I drink that [UNK]'

Andrew: '[UNK] going to be recorded [UNK] everything.'

Dorothy: 'Funny expression isn't it, that one?
Please may I have some tea?'

Andrew: 'Certainly my dear.'

Dorothy: 'Thank you.

Andrew: 'Work work and more work.'

Dorothy: 'Oh.'

Andrew: '[UNK] suppose Julia will be there.
[UNK] boss [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Suppose the what, sorry?'

Andrew: 'Don't suppose Julia will be there.
My boss is getting to the position where he wants lots of information from me.'

Andrew: 'Last night, before I came home he dragged me into his office to work out how much money we spend [UNK] Pontypool delivering parts to Solihull.'

Dorothy: 'And do you know?
No, so you had to sit and work it out.'

Andrew: 'We had, we had to work it out.
Yeah.
I sat with a price list.
He sat with a calculator.'

Andrew: 'He only did that simply because he gets asked questions.'

Dorothy: 'Mm.'

Andrew: 'Thing I don't approve of is the fact that when I ask questions'

Dorothy: 'You don't get'

Andrew: 'that he needs and he needs to speak to his boss, he doesn't get answers from his boss.
But when his boss chases him for, you know information or whatever you know [UNK].'

Christopher: 'I only got four sultanas'

Dorothy: '[UNK] information.'

Christopher: 'today.'

Andrew: 'It's stopped has it?'

Christopher: 'Four sultanas today.'

Dorothy: 'Oh dear. [UNK]'

Christopher: 'There's lots of Alpen in here but not very many sultanas.'

Dorothy: 'Really?
They're probably all at the bottom.'

Christopher: 'What?'

Dorothy: 'They are probably all at the bottom.'

Christopher: '[UNK] You say they're always at the top.'

Dorothy: 'Actually they do tend to be, don't they?
They tend to be at the top and then there's sort of little bits and pieces go at the bottom.
So perhaps you'd had it.
Perhaps you won't get any sultanas now.'

Christopher: 'Why?'

Dorothy: 'Till the end of the Alpen.
I don't know.
I'm just guessing.'

Andrew: 'I'm afraid the toast wasn't very square shaped.'

Andrew: 'Somebody must have sat on the loaf or something.'

Dorothy: 'Probably squashed it on the way home from Tesco's.'

Tim: '[UNK] you squash it.
Then [UNK]'

Andrew: 'Well it did get squashed.
Did you see?
What's happened to the loaf?
Somebody must have sat on it, or pulled it or [UNK]'

Tim: '[UNK] if you do that'

Christopher: 'I [UNK] one.'

Andrew: 'No.
You'll find your sandwiches at work will be a little, your sandwiches at school will be a little bit squashed.'

Andrew: 'Well he works.'

Dorothy: 'He works at school.'

Christopher: 'What?'

Dorothy: 'Daddy told, said when your sandwiches are at work.'

Andrew: 'You know what I meant.'

Dorothy: 'He meant at school.
But then he said you do work at school so it's alright.'

Andrew: 'Course he does.
Works very hard.'

Christopher: 'Oh, it's a big fat one, this.'

Tim: 'Be careful stop.
You're having all of it.'

Andrew: '[UNK] And I had to spend a whole hour in a meeting not not an hour, two and a half hours in a'

Christopher: 'I still haven't got very little much'

Andrew: 'meeting with the French yesterday with [UNK]'

Andrew: 'To listen to the French to say non.
You know'

Andrew: 'the French say non.
Except they didn't quite say non, one word.'

Tim: 'And I haven't.'

Andrew: 'They said it in a round about way for two and a half hours.'

Christopher: 'Look at mine.'

Tim: 'Look at mine [UNK].'

Andrew: 'We knew they were coming to say non.
That's why the meeting had been arranged.'

Dorothy: 'They didn't need to take two and a half hours over it.'

Christopher: '[UNK] Look at mine.
I didn't have any.'

Tim: 'And look at mine, I've finished.'

Christopher: 'I've finished.'

Tim: 'And me.'

Tim: 'I need some more milk.'

Dorothy: 'Would everybody stop shrieking.
Hands off the jug please.'

Tim: 'Off the jug.'

Dorothy: 'What's the problem?'

Christopher: 'I want a drink please.'

Dorothy: 'There's some for you.'

Christopher: 'Ugh.'

Dorothy: 'And some for you.'

Dorothy: 'And nobody ask for any more till [UNK] toast.'

Tim: 'That's a lot.'

Andrew: 'Ooh, a cat.'

Christopher: 'Nobody'

Dorothy: 'Go away pussy.'

Christopher: 'Why?'

Tim: 'Go away.

Andrew: '[UNK] I think all the'

Tim: 'Mum.
Mummy.
Mummy.'

Andrew: 'big green pellet things [UNK]'

Christopher: 'Mum why did you say go away?'

Dorothy: 'Please don't shout at me.
I don't like it.'

Christopher: 'Why did you say go away when he wasn't on the flowers?'

Dorothy: 'Well, I don't mind him walking across that bit but'

Christopher: 'But why did he shout it?'

Dorothy: 'Who, Tim?'

Christopher: 'Mm.
That might be why he's gone away.'

Dorothy: 'Well that's alright.
We don't mind that.
What did you try to say?'

Tim: 'Mum.'

Dorothy: 'Yes.'

Tim: 'I saw a black cat on the step.'

Dorothy: 'Did you?'

Tim: 'But he went away.'

Dorothy: 'Oh.'

Tim: 'Cos I shouted go away then he went.'

Dorothy: '.
Right.
We're not, not very friendly towards cats here are we?
I don't mind other people's cats in their homes like erm there's a cat at Holly Cottage isn't there?'

Tim: 'Yeah, a black one.'

Dorothy: 'Is that a nice cat, do you stroke it?'

Tim: 'Yeah.'

Christopher: 'Yes it is a nice one mummy.'

Dorothy: 'Remember it do you?'

Christopher: 'Yeah. [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'It's the ones that come along and just have to do things in the middle of the garden.'

Christopher: 'There's a few little flaps mummy'

Andrew: 'That's right.'

Christopher: 'in Holly Cottage where it can go through and it's a great'

Dorothy: 'Oh that's nice.'

Christopher: 'it's very big and they're only small flaps.'

Dorothy: 'Mm.
Cat flap.
Well you can see how cats can squeeze underneath fences'

Christopher: 'Mm.'

Dorothy: 'so I'm sure they can squeeze through cat flaps if they need to.
Is he meant to have half of that?'

Andrew: 'Yes.'

Christopher: 'I don't want half.'

Tim: 'It is raining.
Mummy, it is raining.'

Christopher: '[UNK] I don't want ha I don't want half.
I want a whole.'

Andrew: 'And what's Tim going to eat?'

Christopher: 'Nothing.
Could you make another one for him?'

Christopher: 'Make another one for him dad.
Make another one for him.'

Tim: 'No. [UNK]'

Andrew: '[UNK] doesn't it?'

Dorothy: 'What's that?'

Andrew: 'The amount of toast consumed.'

Dorothy: '[UNK] off colour day wasn't it?
Whenever it was.'

Andrew: 'How's your throat today?'

Dorothy: 'Much better today.
I think it suddenly improved.
I would advise Tarazets if you want to try and get rid of it.
It's definitely worked for me.
Suck Tarazets if [UNK].'

Tim: 'Think I need, think I need some Tarazets.
My throat's hurting.'

Andrew: 'Your throat's hurting is it?
Oh.

Christopher: 'Mum's on it's mum's is on it's way out.'

Tim: 'If I have it o one first, then you, then him then'

Tim: 'Think you [UNK] your jumper.'

Christopher: 'I didn't.
Where is my marmalade?
[UNK] Marmite.'

Andrew: 'If you said please may I have the marmalade it might arrive.'

Christopher: '[UNK] Why has it got a mar and E on the end?'

Dorothy: 'Cos otherwise it would be marmit.
See, marmit [UNK] I it's marmite.'

Christopher: 'Mum'

Tim: 'Where's the marmalade?'

Andrew: 'Right in front of you.'

Tim: 'Where?

Tim: '[UNK] my milk.'

Christopher: '[UNK] Yes he is kneeling up.'

Andrew: 'So, this afternoon'

Dorothy: 'Mhm.
When we go to the dentist.'

Andrew: 'we gather at the dentist at four o'clock.'

Dorothy: '[UNK] Shall we gather at the dentist.'

Andrew: 'You'll get there just before.
Erm will you be able to take some money?'

Dorothy: 'A chequebook, I'll take.'

Andrew: 'Right.
Cos it costs so much now.
I think they put the rate up didn't they?
Recently.'

Dorothy: 'Did they?'

Andrew: 'Yeah. [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'So how much is it now, for children?'

Christopher: 'It's Ruth's birthday today.'

Dorothy: 'It is Ruth's birthday today.
That's very clever.
How do you know that?'

Christopher: 'Mm mm.'

Andrew: 'He just remembers these things.'

Christopher: 'Mm.'

Tim: 'It's not your birthday [UNK]'

Andrew: 'No, Ruth's.'

Dorothy: 'No not mine.
Ruth's'

Andrew: 'Your cousin.'

Dorothy: 'Cousin Ruth.
Remember Ruth?
Went to stay with them and [UNK] Ruth came to read to you in the morning.
Oh no, Ann came to read to you in the mornings didn't she?
Ruth wasn't with us in the mornings.'

Tim: 'Ruth.'

Andrew: 'Yes, you remember.
Ruth and Ann'

Andrew: 'and Uncle David and Auntie Gwen.
Do you remember them?
We went to stay in their house one weekend.
And we went with them to the zoo.
Do you remember?'

Dorothy: 'Oh yes.'

Andrew: 'Remember going to the zoo?
We went on a little steam train as well.'

Dorothy: 'And you and me nearly nearly didn't get on the train.
Do you remember the train?
They were all waiting for us.
We had to run quick.'

Tim: 'Why?'

Dorothy: 'I can't remember what we were doing.
Probably weeing up a tree somewhere.'

Tim: '[UNK] because, think the train nearly went.'

Andrew: 'Yes.'

Dorothy: 'Everybody else was sitting on the train.
We had to run quick to get on it.'

Tim: 'Because, because the little train nearly without us.'

Dorothy: 'Mm.
Did nearly go without us.'

Christopher: 'If it went without you'

Dorothy: 'We'd have to catch the next one.'

Christopher: 'Mm.'

Andrew: 'That's right.
Cos there's only one train.
It was going round and round wasn't it?'

Christopher: 'Mm.'

Tim: 'We'd have to wait for the next one then.'

Dorothy: 'Mm.'

Andrew: 'So are we all being examined today?'

Dorothy: 'We are, this is a family trip.'

Andrew: 'Right.'

Dorothy: 'Because [UNK] said, are the children coming for a check up too.'

Tim: 'Well, I have some Marmite.'

Dorothy: 'Cos otherwise it's silly if we go'

Andrew: 'Yeah.'

Dorothy: 'and then they go and they never know where they are.'

Tim: 'Can I have some Marmite on this? [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Are the children supposed to go every six months?'

Andrew: 'Something like that.'

Dorothy: 'Well that's okay.
So it ought to work out twelve and a six month [UNK]'

Tim: 'Mum.'

Dorothy: 'so that we go every twelve and they go every six.'

Tim: 'Can you chop it?'

Dorothy: 'But somehow or another it got out of sequence.'

Tim: 'Can you chop No chop it.'

Dorothy: 'Oh chop, sorry.
I'm not listening to you am I?'

Andrew: 'Presuming that our dentist still wants to do National Health Service work.
Cos most of them are threatening to give up aren't they?'

Dorothy: 'Are they?'

Tim: 'No.'

Andrew: 'Yeah. [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'And do what?
Private?'

Tim: 'Mum mum.'

Andrew: 'Private work.
Cos they say they don't get paid enough money for the N H S.'

Dorothy: 'So people like, except the children you mean?'

Andrew: 'No.
For everybody.
The vast majority of dentists have threatened to [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Well how come when we're paying so much?
Do you want'

Andrew: 'Well because you'd have to pay even more if you did it privately.'

Tim: 'My throat hurts.'

Dorothy: 'Oh I see.'

Dorothy: 'Is it dear?
Do you want two [UNK]?'

Tim: 'Yeah.'

Christopher: 'Mm mm mm.
A [UNK] please.'

Christopher: 'A messy [UNK].
A [UNK]?
What's a [UNK]?
I can't wear my new shoes this morning can I?'

Dorothy: 'Why not?
Oh no you can't cos it's school.
You can wear them when you get home.'

Christopher: 'Mm.'

Dorothy: 'And walk to the dentist.'

Christopher: 'What?'

Dorothy: 'And walk to the dentist in your new shoes.'

Christopher: 'And at the dentists.'

Dorothy: 'Yeah.
Well you don't take your shoes off at the dentists.'

Dorothy: 'He doesn't look at your feet, he only looks at your teeth.
He'll get a shock when he sees your teeth won't he?
Four of them have changed since you last came.'

Christopher: 'Is it today?
Is it today?'

Dorothy: 'Mhm.'

Christopher: 'Oh.
It feels funny when she you do it.
Mum.'

Dorothy: 'Yeah.'

Christopher: 'Is it are you going to be checked?'

Dorothy: 'Yes.
Mummy and daddy and you two.
We're all going, family trip.'

Tim: 'And me?'

Dorothy: 'Mhm.'

Christopher: 'At the bed time?'

Dorothy: 'Yes and you.'

Christopher: 'At bed time?'

Dorothy: 'No, four o'clock it is.'

Tim: 'I'm gonna look at my teeth.'

Dorothy: 'It's a little, it's a little ploy to get daddy home early.'

Christopher: 'What?'

Tim: '[UNK] gonna look at my teeth?'

Dorothy: 'Daddy'll have to come home a bit early to have it done.'

Tim: '[UNK] gonna look at my teeth?'

Dorothy: 'Yes.
Will you let him?
Yes?
Will you sit on the chair, open your mouth, let him stick a mirror in?
Aah.'

Christopher: 'Stick a mirror in?
We don't'

Dorothy: 'I seem to remember last time you got two stickers didn't you, cos you had super clean teeth?
I bet you only get one sticker this time.'

Christopher: 'Why?'

Tim: 'You think I'm gonna get two?'

Christopher: 'You'd have to clean them out very [UNK] did that.'

Dorothy: 'I think you were a bit lucky to get two stickers.
I would have thought one sticker would be sufficient really.'

Christopher: 'It was when Mrs [UNK] was there then wasn't it mummy?'

Dorothy: 'Was it?'

Christopher: 'Mrs [UNK] was there.'

Dorothy: 'Mm probably.
Mm.'

Christopher: 'It was.'

Dorothy: 'Oh you went to school didn't you?
There was a dentist came to school, remember?
And we had a letter home saying something about you need to go to the local dentist or something for treatment.
Poss no possible treatment.
And I think it was cos of the wobbly front tooth when you bent it back when you fell over my foot.'

Christopher: 'But next time it won't'

Dorothy: 'So we didn't bother going because we were regularly going anyway.'

Christopher: 'What?'

Christopher: 'You didn't bother going cos we'

Dorothy: 'No.'

Christopher: 'were regularly going?'

Dorothy: 'Yeah.
Well I didn't see much point'

Christopher: 'What does regularly mean?'

Dorothy: 'Regularly means that we go in anyway t every six months you go and have your teeth checked to see if they're okay.'

Christopher: 'Every six'

Dorothy: 'So just when some some bod comes to school and opens your mouth and says ooh, this looks interesting, there's not much point because our own dentist knows about it.'

Christopher: 'So you don't really need to be checked at school? [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'No I wouldn't have thought so.
But some people don't go to the dentist regularly, so they need to be checked at school.
People like Michelle probably never set eyes on a dentist normally.
It's probably a good thing for a dentist to have a look at her teeth and see what needs doing.'

Christopher: 'Because her mum and her mum doesn't [UNK]?'

Dorothy: 'Mm probably.'

Christopher: 'They've never been?'

Dorothy: 'Probably not.'

Christopher: 'Why?'

Tim: 'We have.'

Dorothy: 'I'm just guessing.
We've been, yeah.
But not everybody does.
Well not everybody likes dentists and they think that something'

Tim: 'Well well we'

Dorothy: 'awful's gonna happen to them.
They're wrong'

Christopher: 'What?'

Dorothy: 'cos it's nice isn't it, at the dentist?'

Tim: 'Think everyone goes.'

Christopher: 'To the dentist.'

Dorothy: 'Well everybody ought to go to the dentist if they want to keep their teeth nice and healthy.
But not everybody does cos some people get frightened of dentists and they think ooh I don't want to go there.
But that's silly cos there's nothing to be frightened of is there?
It's nice at the dentist.'

Tim: 'No no-one can get frightened.'

Dorothy: 'Mm.'

Christopher: 'But they won't get stickers will they?'

Dorothy: 'True.'

Tim: 'They won't get stickers dad.'

Tim: 'If they go'

Christopher: '[UNK] got toothbrushes to give you [UNK] but the [UNK] [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'Mm.'

Christopher: 'can't see that can you?'

Dorothy: 'No, you can't see that.
That's why you need a mirror.'

Tim: 'Could I have one of those [UNK]?'

Dorothy: 'Can you have what?'

Tim: 'Have one of those things.'

Dorothy: 'What things?'

Tim: 'Those pink things that af after we had our lunch.'

Dorothy: 'Pink things?'

Tim: 'Yeah.
Er those things in that bottle.'

Dorothy: 'Oh I know what you mean.
For your throat?'

Tim: 'Yeah.'

Dorothy: 'Yes you can do, just wipe your hands first.'

Christopher: 'Why?'

Dorothy: 'Well he's got his sore throat here.'

Christopher: 'I've got a sore throat too.'

Dorothy: 'Have you?
Right.'

Tim: 'And you.'

Dorothy: 'You can have one each.'

Christopher: 'Where are they?'

Dorothy: 'In the kitchen.'

Christopher: 'Would I spot it?'

Dorothy: 'I don't know.'

Tim: 'Think I'm going to get them because I I [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'No Tim.
Mummy has to get those.
It says on the bottle, only mummies touch medicines.
Well no, not quite but [UNK]'

Christopher: 'It doesn't really. [UNK]'

Dorothy: 'One for you.
One for Tim.'

Dorothy: 'One for you, daddy, would you like one of these [UNK].'

Christopher: 'One yeah cos he's allowed [UNK].
He's allowed to have one.'

Dorothy: 'Yeah. [UNK]'

Tim: 'I I I've got one.'

Andrew: 'Have you?
Yes.'

Christopher: 'I've got one.'

Tim: 'Look.'

Andrew: 'Yes.'

Christopher: 'Already had these before daddy.'

Tim: 'And me.'

Tim: 'I I I I had another piece.'

Andrew: 'Right.
Are we gonna have a song?
I shouldn't be here.
I'm late.
It's got to be very very quick.'

Dorothy: 'Very very quick. [UNK]'

Tim: 'And I want to watch the telly.'

Dorothy: 'Well hold on cos [UNK]'

Andrew: 'Right.

Tim: 'Can I have be bold?'

Andrew: 'Right.'

Dorothy: 'Yes.

Andrew: '[UNK] just gonna have a prayer, right.

Christopher: 'Be bold.'

Andrew: 'we pray that you'll be with us today.
That you'll help us as we go out.
Go to nursery and school and work and do different things.
Pray that we'll listen to you.
To help us to be friends to those we meet.
That you'll look after and keep us safe until the end of the day.

Bom bom'

Tim: 'Now your turn.'

Christopher: 'Jesus' love is very wonderful.'

Tim: 'Where's dad?'

Dorothy: 'Dad's in the kitchen.'

Andrew: 'Bubye funny.'

Tim: 'No [UNK]'

Andrew: 'Bubye bubye bubye'

Dorothy: 'You sound like a monkey.'

Andrew: 'Bubye.
Bubye.'

Dorothy: 'No-one's listening to a word you're saying Tim.
What's your problem?'

Tim: '[UNK] Jesus [UNK].'

Dorothy: 'You want to sing Jesus [UNK]?'

Tim: 'Yeah, with dad.'

Dorothy: 'Dad's gone I'm afraid cos he's gonna be late.'

Christopher: 'Jesus' love is very wonderful, Jesus' love is very wonderful Jesus' love is very wonderful, very wonderful love'

[UNK]: 'very wonderful, Jesus' love is very wonderful Jesus' love is very wonderful, oh wonderful love'

She sits there and does them twice as fast as me.

Gwen: 'Yes.'

Dorothy: 'So I don't mind doing the pictures.
If she'd do the sleeves and the back for me I'd be very grateful.'

Gwen: 'Yeah.'

Gwen: 'It's like doing tapestry.'

Dorothy: 'Yeah.'
