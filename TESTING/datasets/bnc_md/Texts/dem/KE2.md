Margaret: 'the morning again, and we took Daniel up to the er, cos there was a station, Christopher picked him up there and off they went you see so erm haven't heard anything I presume he got back alright but as I say'

Richard: 'A bit resigned to it now?'

Margaret: 'a bit more resigned, there's another, there's another sort of erm possibility, I mean if they sold their house quickly of course then, you know they'd come down here obviously and they'd try and look for something, but it's not likely that they'd sell their house that quickly'

Richard: 'No'

Margaret: 'but if they did and'

Richard: 'They sell it'

Margaret: 'you know they'd all come down, but if they don't, erm'

Richard: 'Christopher would travel'

Margaret: 'well he'

Richard: 'twelve months'

Terence: 'twelve months or so'

Margaret: 'He's going to be going up erm each weekend if this happens'

Richard: 'Oh yeah I mean that's that's the'

Margaret: 'and erm Marilyn will come down of course when she's at, she's worried as well about whether she's going to get a job, cos er, I mean they need to have erm a second income I should think'

Richard: 'Well yeah, but I don't think the job's erm, I mean that's not the problem for her because she can always go on the agency you see and she can do general midwifery'

Margaret: 'Oh on the agency can you?'

Richard: 'Oh yeah, I mean, I mean she can like'

Richard: 'she used to go to an old person's home of a night time you know'

Richard: 'she'll get paid, she'll get paid travelling and everything for that so that er I don't see that that's erm'

Margaret: 'No well that's probably erm'

Richard: 'no I don't think that's a problem'

Margaret: 'no that's not a great consideration'

Richard: 'I I don't see that as a'

Margaret: 'Well I think it's just'

Richard: 'I mean that could be a short term until she could get herself you know a full time regular post'

Margaret: 'It's erm, you know, mostly Carris of course'

Richard: 'Yeah'

Terence: 'I mean I think if they can'

Margaret: 'but she means if they sell their house they'll come down more every year then'

Terence: 'Yes because in the summer I mean you, some time in the, in this next term would be the ideal thing really because that, if she can stay on for the summer term'

Richard: 'Before September that's right'

Terence: 'erm well most of it I mean she'll be take and erm'

Richard: 'Yes like in September'

Margaret: 'Timothy'

Terence: 'Timothy will take his O levels you see during the summer term, well I mean by the end of June he'd of finished those so that'

Terence: 'Well July, August I mean any'

Richard: 'Well yeah'

Margaret: 'To get settled in'

Richard: 'Yeah'

Terence: 'Mm'

Margaret: 'but erm'

Richard: 'Mm, mm'

Margaret: 'you know after he gets out from here on a temporary basis sort of thing, so that erm Christopher says he's gonna be doing it for a year this lecturing, but it's very nice for him because he'll be able to contact him and Bob will help him if it's necessary'

Richard: 'It'd be a difficult situation that will be for Chris then won't it I mean'

Terence: 'Well Chris says he's gotta keep in with him for a little while, he said he'

Richard: 'Right'

Terence: 'he said I'd, I'd, I'd, I'd rather have, rather have him as a friend than an enemy'

Richard: 'And how did he get out of the Chris think he'd get on with him?'

Margaret: 'Oh very well'

Terence: 'Alright'

Richard: 'Was he on the panel, on the board?'

Terence: 'I don't think so no, but you know I mean, for six months if Christopher's living here and having to go back at the weekend, for six months he gets an allowance'

Margaret: 'A travelling allowance, so'

Richard: 'Get it, yeah'

Margaret: 'that would save them'

Richard: 'yeah but what that doesn't take into account is the tiredness factor is it?'

Terence: 'Oh no it doesn't'

Richard: 'Because you work, you work the long days'

Margaret: 'and go, go by train'

Richard: 'He'll go back by train'

Margaret: 'no question of Chris driving'

Terence: 'Go by train'

Richard: 'yeah, but you've, but you've actually got to do this, I mean, that's right'

Terence: 'I know it doesn't, but at least it'

Margaret: 'We don't know anything'

Richard: 'Oh, no that's'

Margaret: 'But that I mean we didn't even know he was coming, father rang up on erm'

Terence: 'It was ever so funny really'

Margaret: 'Yeah because I had said to father during the day on Sunday, I wonder if any of our children are alive?

Margaret: 'I've put my foot in it again'

Terence: 'perhaps I shouldn't of told you, so I said well look Timothy I said this is a conversation that hasn't taken place I said when Christopher comes back in I said if you want to say anything you can, but feel free not to and we'll just, if he comes we won't know anything about it'

Margaret: 'Play it by ear'

Terence: 'that, that way, he must of said something because Christopher phoned up and said I'm coming down tomorrow'

Margaret: 'Oh she probably heard that I had not been well'

Richard: 'Well that's right'

Margaret: 'that'll be it'

Richard: 'that's what I'd guessed, erm, so I said no, I said they're fine, so she said oh I'm ever so sorry I said don't be I said these sort of things get around, I mean it's, she kept go and then I went on to describe how I virtually done not too a dissimilar thing going up the road trying to talk to people about writing in to object, you know with this planning application and erm, I said I sort of knock on someone's door up there and I thought it was the next door that the husband had died and it was that one'

Margaret: 'Oh dear'

Terence: 'Mm, mm'

Margaret: 'you can't help putting'

Richard: 'I'm going to go to the planning committee meeting there'

Margaret: 'Are you?'

Richard: 'on Monday and then happily leave around about ten o'clock'

Margaret: 'So you can go alright can you?'

Richard: 'Oh yeah'

Margaret: 'They'll, they'll allow you to go?'

Richard: 'Oh yeah you're allowed to go in and watch, you're not allowed to say anything, but I just wanna go in and, and er'

Terence: 'See who says what'

Richard: 'Yeah'

Terence: 'Yeah, that's a good idea, mm'

Margaret: 'Yes well I mean had we had any idea about this, obviously father would of'

Terence: 'Didn't even go to the committee dear, this one'

Margaret: 'Didn't even no I've never even went to the committee, yours was'

Terence: 'That was, that was the trouble with ours'

Margaret: 'going to a committee'

Terence: 'absolutely I'm sure of that'

Richard: 'Well I mean it's, it's well as soon as, it's, well did you write in and object in within the time?'

Margaret: 'Oh yeah, yes'

Terence: 'I wrote, I wrote a foolscap letter with about nine points on it and somebody who, the architect, Chris's architect next door said with a letter like that going in, it must go to the committee'

Richard: 'Mm'

Terence: 'so I wasn't bothered, but it didn't go to the committee and now, afterwards when I'

Richard: 'Mm'

Terence: 'then it was too late'

Richard: 'But you can't appeal against it, you can't appeal against it'

Terence: 'No, no'

Margaret: 'No that's right'

Richard: 'they,'

Terence: 'they can appeal'

Richard: 'they can appeal'

Margaret: 'Yeah'

Terence: 'but you can't and I think it's very wrong that one man should have, be almighty god really, do'

Margaret: 'This present mayor was away on holiday at the time, he said perhaps that I should of seen that erm it would go to committee'

Richard: 'I mean I have gone to the trouble, I have been in to see the planning officer that's dealing with it, erm I've written to every single member of the planning committee, I've written to the Environmental Health who have written back to me saying they offer no objections and there because the smell won't be a problem so I've written them back another stinking letter and saying well erm'

Terence: 'Come and live next door'

Richard: 'I, I completely disagree with your thoughts on the fact that there won't be a smell, so much so that the slightest smell if the, if the er proposal gets the go ahead and I shall be on to your office and asking to speak to you personally, to come and smell this erm'

Margaret: 'And the rubbish, I mean the, the environmental people'

Richard: 'Oh they, they say it's all controllable so that I've, I've answered, I haven't just let the Environmental Health wash over me I've actually written back to them again, er I'll be interested to see whether I get a letter back from them, but I phoned up the Council this morning and they're rejecting on two grounds, one is to do with the highway and the sort of the traffic situation coming in there, although the, the authority, the Highway Department aren't objecting to it and the other one is erm, on local environmental issues I think you know that is, is unsuitably, unsuitable environmentally to the area well I can only say that I'm grateful to the planning, to the planning offices for they're going out on a limb if you like because I think they're on thin ice erm and so long as the committee will, will back them up I mean I don't know of what else I could of done as a person'

Terence: 'No nothing, I don't think you could of done any more, you got it to committee and, and there's nothing more than you can do than that'

Richard: 'erm, so that if, if they then go to an appeal er, I was talking to this planning officer and I was saying that I think I'll consult them, he said I don't think you'll need to he said, and of what you've done so far is pretty good and I can get access to all the letters that have been written in, in objecting into the into the homes'

Margaret: 'Have a lot of other people written in and objecting?'

Richard: 'I think there's I think there's quite a few and I think this is what swayed it, the fact that they have had erm, I know of at least ten say ten, there's one, two, three on the other side of the road which is good because Bob [UNK] which is another one, so that's four, there's [UNK] which is the other side of the shop, is five, there's us, six, Jean seven, the [UNK] eight, erm the guy the other side of the [UNK] which is nine, there is Ginny [UNK] over the and the erm old persons' home, that's ten that I know of for certain about, er and then I've heard of other people were gonna be writing in, now whether they actually did or not I don't know'

Margaret: 'Mm, as you, see you, you really do need'

Richard: 'but I'm sure, if if I've had ten objections, I mean I've done'

Terence: 'You've done very well by that, you know'

Margaret: 'You really have been to houses'

Terence: 'I wish we of had that knowledge when'

Margaret: 'Had we known about it because this is the sort of thing we could of gone'

Terence: 'We would of done the same sort of thing and could of gone in to see the planning officer but I just, I just assumed you know that, that life was fair but of course there's no justice in this life'

Richard: 'But er, the only, the only, yes, no the only other thing I would of said that you could of perhaps done would be go to to a Local Authority ombudsman'

Terence: 'Well I, we went there afterwards'

Richard: 'Did you and what did he say?'

Terence: 'but it was too late you see and there was no, I mean'

Margaret: 'It was passed'

Terence: 'I, I couldn't produce any evidence of malpractice, I mean I could'

Richard: 'No'

Terence: 'think what I'd like, but I couldn't prove anything and erm, so there was nothing that the ombudsman could do at that stage, at, as the stage complete'

Richard: 'Yeah'

Terence: 'erm and there was nothing that a Member of Parliament could do, this is the trouble I mean it, it with everybody was saying you should of contacted us before it went to'

Richard: 'I'm going to see Patrick [UNK] tomorrow, there's a coffee morning up in the village, but erm'

Margaret: 'Well you went to see him'

Terence: 'and he, he is very keen to try and change the law so that people like you and I who is'

Richard: 'can appeal'

Terence: 'can, can appeal against the decision which goes against us, it's, its not fair that we'

Richard: 'because we we're the third party we're not allowed to appeal against it'

Terence: 'It's not fair that the, the other people'

Richard: 'I know'

Terence: 'can appeal but you can't'

Richard: 'I know the person whose house, I mean, I've spoken to Jane [UNK] at some length and I'll probably ring her tonight erm but erm, I, I might go around and see old erm [UNK] tomorrow at a coffee morning I think up in the village'

Margaret: 'But I think that he I find he's'

Terence: 'Anything he does'

Margaret: 'he's very sympathetic to the likes of'

Terence: 'at least, at least you've got it's going to committee, it's not gonna be just on the on the rest on one man'

Margaret: 'One person with er yeah'

Terence: 'erm who will undoubtedly he'll have favourable contacts with the person who was applying.'

Richard: 'I mean as I'm, I don't think they had any option with this I think because it's a change of usage, considerable change of use then it had to go before the committee, erm but erm'

Margaret: 'It's okay, even if they get send down then of course they can still appeal but you can't it's ridiculous'

Terence: 'Well it's not fair'

Margaret: 'No'

Richard: 'That's right and, so I don't know, we erm we live in hopes anyway.'

Terence: 'And how's Helen?'

Richard: 'Alright, I mean she's working long and hard and er'

Terence: 'How does she think she'll do with her A levels?'

Richard: 'Well I think'

Terence: 'Has she had her mocks yet?'

Richard: 'No, not yet she's, she's had an accept, I'm taking her up to Cardiff on Wednesday on a B and two Cs, the thing'

Margaret: 'Yeah'

Terence: 'Oh for going to university?'

Richard: 'Yeah'

Margaret: 'What about her er York which she's had'

Richard: 'She hasn't heard from York she's heard from Leicester'

Margaret: 'She hasn't heard from them yet'

Richard: 'and she's got an acceptance from them on a B and two Cs'

Margaret: 'Oh has she?'

Richard: 'erm'

Margaret: 'Because it was York that was stopping her listing wasn't it?'

Terence: 'What she going to, what she applying to get a degree?'

Richard: 'History'

Terence: 'History'

Richard: 'The trouble is, I mean I can take, I can take her up to Bristol er Cardiff next week, but there's another thing to, to Leicester and I can't get her up to Leicester although she'

Richard: 'on a train, because I've got a governor's meeting that day and, and I can't avoid not being at that governor's meeting because I'm a chairman'

Terence: 'Yeah'

Richard: 'of the building and sites'

Margaret: 'Yeah'

Richard: 'erm ha, I dunno'

Terence: 'When is it for Leicester?'

Richard: 'Do you know I can't remember the date, early part of March, early part of March, erm what she says at the moment is that er someone else from the college is going to Leicester next Wednesday when Helen's going to Cardiff and this girl is then going to Cardiff when Helen should be going to Leicester, so Helen says, and she wants to look at the same subjects as what Helen does so Helen says that they're gonna sort of go to the different colleges and compare notes when they come back from it so she might needn't want to go to Leicester'

Margaret: 'Mm'

Richard: 'erm, so I just, I just don't know, erm, so we just'

Margaret: 'Daniel was saying hasn't she heard from any of her'

Richard: 'so'

Margaret: 'I said I don't honestly, I only know that er, erm'

Richard: 'which is quite nice to have fir to have an acceptance to anyway'

Margaret: 'Yeah very good'

Richard: 'so I don't think she'll get an acceptance to York on a B and two Cs I think York is one of the better'

Margaret: 'Try thinking, do you know somebody used'

Richard: 'better I think'

Margaret: 'to swear about Southampton for history'

Richard: 'I don't know, I can't remember whether she applied for that, I know Harold [UNK] his daughter went up to Southampton and he was horrified at the accommodation she was staying in, up there'

Margaret: 'But I know that erm, for'

Richard: 'I think I've just about finished with it'

Margaret: 'Oh have you?'

Terence: 'Have you?
We've not had an appointment to go back have we since you've been home, but I suppose it was been October when we went'

Richard: 'I've had, I've had two hundred pounds worth, I've given her a cheque for two hundred pounds'

Terence: 'Have you really?
What on earth have they done'

Margaret: 'well he had all sorts of'

Richard: 'I've had two, two, three crowns'

Terence: 'That's only fifteen shillings'

Richard: 'I've had a new plate, I've had a hell of a lot with, with a one of the'

Richard: 'something to one of the teeth'

Terence: 'Yeah'

Richard: 'crown dropped off so she had to put that back on, she never put, I had to get erm have another fitting for it, because she said the purpose of pins in her teeth in the tooth to try and get the crown to sit on, on the pins, erm'

Terence: 'Darling'

Margaret: 'Er I know, he's, he's told me'

Richard: 'and in fact'

Margaret: 'last time I saw him'

Richard: 'I took, I took the cheque around on Monday, I had the, the last appointment on Friday and erm since I've had the abscess, the tooth that's got a crown on top, I think it's been pushed up a little bit and my top teeth, the first two keeps catching was this'

Richard: 'well it never has done I mean that, it's always been like that I've never had'

Richard: 'erm I can put together'

Margaret: 'It's naughty of your mother not to let you have them'

Richard: 'Oh, but this, it was catching the tooth that had the abscessing underneath it'

Margaret: 'Yeah'

Richard: 'god was it painful, and erm, so the crown has got a filling in it now because she, to, to relieve the pressure on the abscess she had to drill right down through the crown, erm to go right through into the root area'

Margaret: 'Get me ash'

Richard: 'to get rid of the abscess, oh god it was painful, it really was, in fact I had it once, I had a load of penicillin, didn't finish the penicillin and it came back again and they had to give me a stronger drug then for five days'

Terence: 'Oh I see'

Margaret: 'Did you erm, did you'

Terence: 'that's the trouble with them'

Margaret: 'have any help?'

Richard: 'Yeah, put it all, I mean they I put that in as'

Terence: 'of course you get that'

Margaret: 'Yes'

Terence: 'you get that back?'

Richard: 'I have to pay tax on that lot mind, but I mean it's something you know like it's still costing me fifty pounds'

Terence: 'Yeah'

Richard: 'erm'

Terence: 'but still that's a bit better than two hundred'

Richard: 'Yeah'

Terence: 'Oh'

Terence: 'Was it?'

Richard: 'she felt much happier about doing it'

Terence: 'Mm'

Terence: 'Ivor somebody, no just a thought'

Richard: 'How old is he?'

Terence: 'Oh sixty five, seventy'

Richard: 'Sixty, no it's not him'

Margaret: 'Retired haven't they, because if somebody came to you cos you see, he was so upset about it'

Terence: 'I think he's coming I think he's coming up to the high week group, what is he?
He's something he's, he's, he's some, something to do with er with er, with the area and erm, and he's coming up for the high week group some time in the next, little while, and I said to him you were the group's'

Terence: 'up there'

Richard: 'Yeah, what did he say?'

Terence: 'Oh I think he was just surprised, I don't think he knew, you know, I mean'

Terence: 'He's erm'

Margaret: 'Kay [UNK] knows him cos he's'

Terence: 'he's about, I suppose he's about my height probably slightly slimmer'

Margaret: 'Slimmer'

Terence: 'He's got, he's got a big, a very big scout badge on his lapel'

Margaret: 'And he had a scout badge on his tie, did you notice that?'

Richard: 'erm, I'm at the process of now looking to spend certainly four hundred pound on a tent and maybe'

Terence: 'Well I, I, I mean I wouldn't of thought that'

Margaret: 'Your, your best bet would be to go up and sort of you know look at the tents that are up there so that you would know whether they went about'

Terence: 'I'm meeting him nine o'clock Tuesday morning at the hall'

Margaret: 'But I suppose you could go and look tomorrow morning'

Richard: 'I'm at work erm well'

Margaret: 'he's off tomorrow'

Richard: 'erm, I, well I can't commit myself to going down to that to, I mean if it's, if I can I'll give you a ring because with Cherry being off as well it's, I mean it's gonna be unfair if I start, cos I've been so much'

Terence: 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah'

Margaret: 'but if, if you are going to be spending a whole lot of money on tents and if these were any good'

Richard: 'Well I mean it's, this it's patrol, it's two patrol tents in particular that I'm looking at, if they've got some decent er scout tents'

Terence: 'I must say I mean I, I mean er there were two rolls'

Richard: 'How big are the rolls?'

Terence: 'Well I don't think they're big enough for a big tent, I mean one is fairly long, but er I don't'

Margaret: 'But do, would it be'

Terence: 'it wouldn't be any thicker than that I don't suppose, but I mean I wouldn't know'

Richard: 'No, that'

Margaret: 'The thing about it is'

Terence: 'It, it I wouldn't of thought'

Richard: 'Perhaps that doesn't sound like a patrol tent'

Terence: 'No, it doesn't sound like a patrol tent'

Margaret: 'This, er I know Margaret, Margaret erm, what's her name'

Margaret: 'at the time, no, it's, I won't say'

Richard: 'Tents'

Terence: 'Camping equipment'

Margaret: 'tents and camping equipment so that'

Richard: 'I can find out anyway because I can always talk to Andre about it, he'll know er what's being done about it, erm'

Terence: 'Er anyway he, this fellow's gonna, we're going to clear all the rubbish'

Margaret: 'So they, they, they've dropped the erm the group altogether then?'

Richard: 'Yes and the'

Margaret: 'Who else would that involve?'

Richard: 'Well there was an adventure section as well'

Margaret: 'Oh was there'

Richard: 'erm, the adventure section was quite successful in a lot of respects they had quite a few people er attached to it, the scout group and the cub group, cub packs didn't have very many, but erm the adventure section had quite a few people, er and in fact we've got people doing the tent stalls at the moment that are from a seventh mutant, which is, what it was and of course they've disenfranchised if you like er but we're looking, the district is looking to create a new group with Buckland'

Margaret: 'Yeah'

Richard: 'so instead of being the seventh Saint Joseph's we'd be just erm Newton Abbott'

Margaret: 'Yeah'

Richard: 'so the seventh will stay'

Margaret: 'Mm, mm'

Richard: 'and because the Buckinary is so big and really warrants having a stag group over that neck of the woods'

Margaret: 'They could well do'

Richard: 'they are gonna try and hang onto this seventh, so it well might be'

Margaret: 'Resurrected'

Richard: 'that all its equipment is gonna be held on to'

Margaret: 'Yeah'

Richard: 'to try and set up a scout group'

Margaret: 'But in it, it's wicked, in that, in that cupboard they've got two pairs of really good walking boots, when Kay saw them she said it's not their feet, because you see she had the cubs there right from the beginning'

Richard: 'Mum, we have got the ten saws, last year one of the lads left with us a pair of eighty pound boots and fifty pound gaiters, left them and we don't know who they belong to'

Margaret: 'Ain't it awful really?'

Richard: 'the scarper boots you know with the yeti gaiters on'

Oh by the way Miss Hall do you know anything, said P C Garfield, well said Jane I wasn't going to tell, but I think Mr Sandy and their assistant knows something about it, because about twelve thirty this morning I was going to report about the cobwebs and dampness on the walls and I heard Mr Sandy and his assistant talking in the back room.
Well just that they had put the body in my wardrobe, that's a start thanks.
The next day the policeman went where Mr Banks lived and they rang the bell, hello, hello are you Mrs Banks?
Yes, yes I am.
Well we've got some bad news about your son John, oh I think you'd better come in.
Well what have you got to tell me about John?
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, no, I am very sorry to tell you this but your son has been murdered said Sergeant Briggs, murdered, but how?
He was shot, John my poor John, what am I going to tell his wife?
He was married?
Yes to a Mrs Stow before, I'm sorry we have to tell you like this, anyway do you know why he came to the hotel?
Yes he had booked there for a week, I think it was for a business meeting with Mr Sandy, that's all I know.
Mr Sandy, are you sure said P C Garfield?
Yes he's the receptionist there isn't he?
Yes he is, you've been a lot of help, thanks.
At midday Sergeant Briggs and P C Garfield went back to the Riverside Hotel to talk to Mr Sandy.
Do you know anything about Mr Bank's death said Sergeant Briggs?
No, yes you do, don't lie, I heard you yesterday morning, twelve thirty, you were talking to your assistant in the, about you put the body in my wardrobe said Jane, okay I know something, in fact I know a lot more than all of you.
I know who did it.
Who said P C Garfield?
Ah but that would be telling, just tell us said Jane, you really want to know don't you?
Look stop playing games and tell us said Sergeant Brigg, okay it was me said Mr Sandy.
I could of guessed said P C Garfield, but why?
Well I was having an affair with his wife and I loved her so much I wanted to marry her, I wanted his land and his money, so I thought if he was out of the way it would be easier to get what I wanted and of course it was.
I hope you know how many years you'll get for this said P C Garfield, of course I do I'm not stupid.
Well if you come with me sir, I think it's gonna be about eighteen years for you mate, said Sergeant Briggs, thanks for all your work Jane, that's alright Sarge, a quiet weekend that's all I wanted, some weekend this has turned out to be said Jane'

Terence: 'Very good, right, good, let's hear yours'

Lucy: 'I'll just read this bit'

Terence: 'and we'll talk about it later on, yes go on.'

Lucy: 'If you Liz, Elizabeth pretending to be Jessica or is Elizabeth really Elizabeth.
Chapter one, Elizabeth'

Lucy: 'was sitting comfortably on a low branch on a tall pine tree in the Wakefield's back garden, she had her knees up round her chin and was leaning against the trunk, this was Elizabeth's thinking seat, the place that she went to be alone, there was a lot to think about, tomorrow Mrs, Mr Davis her form teacher would announce the winner of the class essay contest.
Elizabeth had written about saving the world and she thought her essay had a chance of winning, the prize was a year's subscription to the winner's favourite magazine.
Elizabeth was going to subscribe to the mysteries around the world, she loved reading Amanda Howard mysteries, but she was also looking forward to tomorrow because it was the first of April, April fool day, April fools day.
The day went, her and her sister, her twin sister, Jessica, did their annual April fools day joke, they'

## 038001

Lucy: 'Elizabeth had won the essay competition and was just about to stand up when Jessica got up and she walked up to Mr [UNK] and she asked and he asked her what magazine she wanted for the year and she said Rock Seventeen Jessica knew what magazine Elizabeth wanted and she just said Rock Seventeen.
Then she had to stay behind and got Jessica's detention and was late for her next lesson and got another detention for running in the main building.
But the trouble was they were both at the same time after school where she was meant to be decorating the hall for the disco after school that night.
Then, she got Jessica's C for her cooking class instead of the A Jessica got off hers.
But, after school she went to her detention with Mr [UNK] and course, the note said going to the dentist, sudden toothache.
So she went to her other detention and there was another note saying, had to pick up my child from school.
So, she went to decorate the hall and got sent out with people saying she was Jessica.
[UNK] Elizabeth slammed the kitchen door and dropped her bag.
What's wrong said Jessica?
So Elizabeth told her everything that had happened today and after half an hour they decided to tell everyone what the they had done at the disco that night.
So that night, at the disco they told them and at last they believed them and sorted out the magazine thing and changed the magazine to Mysteries from Around the World.
And then, they changed the cookery marks.
And Jessica said, I'll race to the cake and the twins were back to normal.'

Terence: 'Mm!
Now right!
Well I am going to have to look at them both.
And see if I, I like them both.
There's, there's a lot of work gone into those [UNK].
Erm i if I'm honest I think I found Holly's easier to understand on a first reading but that may be because I think perhaps read it.
Perhaps, in a slightly more clearer way than you did.
That doesn't mean that yours isn't as good.
So I, what I want to do now, and I have do eve take time to do it, I can't do it just now when you're here.
But I want to look at them both and I will go through them as well and mark them for spelling and for for your punctuation and everything else.
But, really you both put a tremendous amount of work in!
They're great!'

Lucy: 'Can I just say something?'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Lucy: 'Cos, didn't gonna say know when Jessica got up cos I've got pretend erm got up for the erm'

Terence: 'So what's it?
What is it?
It's April Fool.'

Lucy: 'Yeah, it's April Fool's'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Lucy: 'day.
Er, what they do, every year they switch identities e, Jessica pretends to be Elizabeth, and Elizabeth pretends to be Jessica but, this year they don't do that cos tha all their friends like know and, this year cos their teachers and things still think that they're erm so, they swapped identities they like, give detention and things to the wrong people and stuff like that.
And, when Jessica gets up to do get the magazine it's cos Mr [UNK] told her but course she thought it was Je, erm Elizabeth but she wa wasn't so'

Terence: 'What's D T?'

Lucy: 'That's detention.'

Terence: 'She went to her detention, I see!
Right.'

Lucy: 'So we just sort of say [UNK] essay, D T to show what I mean.'

Terence: 'Yeah.
Well well yes we used to get used to get detention, yes, but erm the thing we used to get more than anything else was pink paper.'

Holly: 'Mm?'

Lucy: 'Did you have to take it home to your parents?'

Terence: 'Pink paper'

Lucy: 'To show that you've'

Terence: 'was'

Lucy: 'been naughty?'

Terence: 'Pink paper was a foolscap sheet of paper like [UNK] like that'

Holly: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'but it was pink!'

Lucy: 'Pink!'

Terence: 'And if you had to do if you had, say, three sheets of pink paper because you've been naughty and done something wrong, you had to fill three sides of pink foolscap paper with writing.
You might have to write an essay or you do copy writing on the pa, do three sheets of pink paper, you had to three sheets of writing!
And it was pink paper and at the top it had space for your parent's signature so that when you've done the work your parents had to'

Holly: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'sign it so they'd know if you'd had pink paper.'

Lucy: 'What erm'

Terence: 'That was the, that was the worst, that was the pink paper, and then'

Lucy: 'what we normally have to do.'

Terence: 'you got yo would have to take and hour or take two hours, or take three hours and if you take up to three hours or if you got three separate hours that was detention and if we were in our in the junior part of the school in the first three forms erm, you then had to go into school on Saturday morning.
In the senior school we had to go into school Saturday morning anyway!'

Holly: 'And you had Wednesday'

Terence: 'We we'

Holly: 'afternoon off.'

Terence: 'No, we didn't!
We we worked Monday to Saturday'

Holly: 'Our when my'

Terence: 'morning.'

Holly: 'When my'

Terence: 'We had games on Wednesday afternoon but we had, in the senior school'

Holly: 'When my'

Terence: 'we had school on Saturday morning as well as the rest of the week!'

Holly: 'My erm my dad's mum, they used to go to school Monday, Tuesday Wednesday morning, have Wednesday afternoon off, all day Thursday, all day Friday and Saturday morning!
But they would have Wednesday afternoon off.'

Lucy: 'Oh!'

Terence: 'Right.'

Holly: 'For some reason!'

Terence: 'Okay.
So we've got a little time left.
Erm let's have a look at your English these English progress papers.'

Holly: 'Okay.'

Terence: 'Because, I want to do a little bit of that erm we are going'

Lucy: 'Ah!'

Terence: 'what page are we on now? [UNK]'

Holly: 'We started something last week.
[UNK], I mean I've finished that.'

Terence: 'Yes, what paper was that?'

Lucy: 'The Locuses.'

Holly: 'About the Locusts.'

Terence: 'What page was that?'

Holly: 'I don't know.'

Lucy: 'I don't know.'

Lucy: 'Here it is!
Here's the page.'

Terence: 'Page twenty eight.
Page twenty eight.
That's right.
Now, how far did we get with that?'

Lucy: 'Erm, we finished the bit about the locusts.'

Terence: 'Right.
So'

Holly: 'Ten to five.'

Terence: 'Okay.'

Terence: 'Number eight we've got to do.
I think.'

Lucy: 'Look, look!
Look!'

Terence: 'Yes.
Number eight.'

Holly: 'I think you hold it right at the end.'

Lucy: 'Do you?'

Holly: 'Do this don't you?'

Lucy: 'Oh you do don't you?'

Terence: 'Did we mark it?'

Lucy: 'No.'

Holly: 'The'

Terence: 'Did we not mark it?'

Holly: 'They're all ma they're alright though.
Cos we didn't [UNK]'

Terence: 'Cos we but we didn't the last one?
So right!
Okay.
So we'll go on to page that page twenty eight, number eight.
If you'd like to do it now and then we'll mark it.'

Lucy: 'Number eight?'

Terence: 'Number eight.'

Holly: 'Paper over'

Lucy: 'Oh!'

Holly: 'there.'

Lucy: 'Yes!'

Holly: 'Underline the correct answer in the brackets.'

Terence: 'So write it down, don't underline it.
Just write the, write the sentence down.'

Holly: 'How do you write it though?'

Terence: 'You gotta choose the correct one.'

Lucy: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'This should be very apt from what you've just been doing.'

Holly: 'Mm!'

Lucy: 'My, am I, am I an author now?'

Terence: 'I don't know.'

Lucy: 'Mm?'

Terence: 'That might well be mightn't it?'

Terence: 'I know I'm, no I'm just coming to sort you out because as you say you did that with Mrs [UNK].
So, you haven't done this yet?'

Holly: 'I've done that Terry.'

Terence: 'Right.
Wait for Lucy to do it and then we'll read it out.'

Lucy: 'Oh!
Ooh ooh ooh!'

Holly: 'Don't think, the spelling's wrong.'

Lucy: 'Yes I have!
Cos I I'm usually a good speller!
One of these.
Over to dad and Becky.'

Holly: 'Oh, she's terrible!'

Lucy: 'Mm.
Doesn't know how to spell scene!'

Terence: 'Does she not?'

Holly: 'No, she'

Lucy: 'No.'

Holly: 'i, when we have like, something like scene one she puts S double E N!'

Lucy: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'Oh!'

Holly: 'She doesn't know how to spell having.
She goes, she puts erm, A, hey, no H, H A V E I N G!
She's useless at spelling!'

Terence: 'Right, so what have you got there?'

Terence: 'Well now, it should a be a person who writes books is'

Lucy: 'An.'

Terence: 'An.'

Lucy: 'An!'

Holly: 'Oh!'

Terence: 'An author.'

Holly: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'An author.
Why do you put an instead of a?'

Holly: 'Because it's got a vowel!'

Terence: 'Because author'

Lucy: 'A vowel.'

Terence: 'comme, starts with an A, right, a vowel.
Right, number nine.
So do number nine.'

Holly: 'Mhm!
Oh!'

Terence: 'So what have you got?'

Lucy: 'It's a journalist.'

Holly: 'Journalist.'

Terence: 'A person who writes articles for a newspaper is a journalist.'

Lucy: 'For a newspaper is a journalist.'

Holly: 'Journalist!'

Terence: 'Good!
Right!
Number ten then.'

Lucy: 'When he breaks Oh sorry I didn't mean to'

Terence: 'It's when'

Terence: 'we break into a house to steal is called a'

Lucy: 'It's called it's called a prisoner!'

Holly: 'Mm mm.
Do you know the story o, first of all I was gonna write about fairground about a erm ghost'

Lucy: 'Ghost'

Holly: 'train then I thought, no, I wouldn't write that.
Then I was gonna write about a hotel you know, erm Heartbreak Hotel thought no, wouldn't write about that.
Want something exciting, so I thought a murder [UNK]!'

Terence: 'Yes.
So it's a burglar, right?
B U R G L A R.'

Holly: 'A murder.'

Terence: 'E actually yours made me think of a story that I was told many years ago on a coach trip over Dartmoor'

Holly: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'when a lady who lived on Dartmoor for many, many years erm was telling stories of things that had actually happened'

Lucy: 'True?'

Terence: 'to her.
Well, for instance, that she lived in a in an old vicarage, cos her husband had been a a, no a tri, priest in the Church of England and er we her house was haunted and she was telling us stories and sh she quite often saw the ghost, she was never worried, she never cos it never frightened her it wasn't vicious or anything like that and she often saw it quite matter of fact.
As a matter of fact, she often saw this ghost.
But, she was telling the story of a man who was travelling over the moor and it was many years ago [UNK] on horseback and er he was completely lost and wan, it was getting dark and he wanted to stay somewhere for the night and he sort of travelled and couldn't see anywhere and eventually down a long drive he saw a house wi, blazing with lights so he went down this house and er, all the windows were alight, you know were lit up and he knocked at the door and knocked at the door, and knocked at the door and couldn't get any answer, no one ever came to the door so in desperation he thought well this is no good!
So he went back up onto the main road and very little further on, in fact, he in fact found a village and spent the night at the hostelry and he said to the man in the hostelry you know, he that he'd been lost and that a a little bit back on the road he'd seen this big house all alight and he had erm, you know, gone in the drive and tried to get get a room there but couldn't make anybody hear and the erm the inn keeper said, no he said er you wouldn't make anyone hear there, he said and if you go back there tomorrow the house won't be there!
And he went back and it wasn't!'

Holly: 'Weird!'

Lucy: 'Why not?'

Terence: 'It had gone!'

Holly: 'What a ghost made it?'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Lucy: 'I like, I love'

Terence: 'Told a lot of ghost stories, yes!'

Lucy: 'I love listening'

Terence: 'in my [UNK]'

Lucy: 'to ghost stories in Dartmoor.'

Holly: 'Oh I know this really [UNK] story!'

Lucy: 'Go on then.'

Holly: 'Right, it's about this erm lady, I'll make it that she lived on Dartmoor with her erm grandson erm and her moth and he sa daughter and she is a gran, she was a grandlady a grandmother.'

Lucy: 'A grandlady!'

Holly: 'And erm, they lived in this little cottage and erm every night erm the moth, she would always stay up really late and the mother and erm her son would go to bed and she would always go out of this erm go out of the house every night and she would go, cos she had these three fingers which were blades'

Lucy: 'Oh!'

Holly: 'you know like Freddy Kruger three fingers that looked like blades and every night she would go to erm the fields and erm she would go into sheep fields and cow fields and she would kill three sheep and a cow every night except for a Sunday night!
Every morning farmers would come and they would see this claw mark on the neck of these of their sheep and their cows and they were, they were quite worried cos all their sheep and cows were like dying every night!
They were quite worried about it.
And so they went to report to the, to the police but and th I mean they didn't believe them, they thought it was just like birds.
And erm and she kept doing this for ages and erm she was, she was sta starting to get worried because people might believe, find out that it was her and so after she killed a cow, she took out all of i, all it's insides and hid in it and no one ever found her!'

Terence: 'Oh dear!
Terrible!'

Holly: 'And then, she'

Terence: 'Ooh!'

Lucy: 'Ooh!'

Holly: 'she was'

Lucy: 'It's horrible isn't it?'

Holly: 'And then she hid inside this cow!'

Terence: 'Mm!'

Holly: 'And she killed it! [UNK]'

Lucy: '[UNK]?'

Terence: 'Right!
I think we'd'

Lucy: 'Ha.'

Terence: 'better leave it at that hadn't we?
Will you before you come to me next time'

Holly: 'Mhm.'

Terence: 'finish down to number twenty eight?
And learn those spellings?
Right?
So that's going to be page twenty eight and twenty nine.
Okay, learn your spellings!
Now, I'll have to talk to your mums but it may well be that I shan't be here in a fortnight's time so we may'

Holly: 'Oh!'

Terence: 'have to put things back a week.'

Holly: 'Okay.'

Terence: 'But we'll we'll think about that nearer the time.
Alright?'

Lucy: 'Okay.'

Terence: 'Okey-doke And you'll leave your compositions with me and I will look up, and if I can get the marks before then as I probably will I'll let you have them back.
Okay?'

Lucy: 'Okay.'

Terence: 'Right!
So, one more week to go and then you've got a holiday.'

Lucy: 'Yes!'

Terence: 'Ha hum!'

Holly: 'At last!'

Terence: 'Yeah, that's right.
Right?
Bye bye girls!'

Lucy: 'Bye bye!
Ballet now.'

Terence: 'Cor you got ballet now have you?'

Holly: 'Yes we'

Terence: 'Hello Adrian!
Alright?'

Adrian: 'Yes thanks.'

Terence: 'So all set for a break tomorrow?'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'Thank you.
Have I got to give your mummy change this time?'

Adrian: 'Er yeah.'

Terence: 'It looks like it'

Adrian: 'Oh yeah.'

Terence: 'doesn't it?'

Adrian: 'I'll go and get some.'

Terence: 'I know, right.
That's alright.
That's fine.
Erm right!
What book are we on?
Four A.'

Adrian: 'It's alright, this is erm, yours.'

Terence: 'Yeah, I know I was looking for the erm oops!
Now right!
So how have we got on with that?'

Adrian: 'Er ah, I did some at home but we haven't done any booklet work this week.'

Terence: 'You haven't done any booklet work?
Okay.'

Adrian: 'Because we've been doing Pythagoras theorem.'

Terence: 'Oh have you?'

Adrian: 'Yeah.
I'll just show you what we've been doing.'

Terence: 'Yeah.
Show us what you've been doing.
You understand it?'

Adrian: 'Yeah well sort of!
We're erm that's the booklet I'm on at the moment.'

Terence: 'What's this one?
I haven't seen this one.
Oh!'

Adrian: 'It's it's er [UNK]'

Terence: '[UNK]?'

Adrian: 'Yeah.
Did that yu, yesterday.
Not all that.'

Terence: 'Is that from here?'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Adrian: 'Work from that.
And an an the the sheets.
And now I've just started this.
I'm gonna finish the end of C six for homework, and I'm on C six A.
And that's what we've been doing, all about it.'

Terence: 'Right.'

Adrian: 'Okay?'

Terence: 'Yeah.
So do you wanna finish that now?'

Adrian: 'Yeah please.'

Terence: 'Right, okay.'

Adrian: 'I I knew that erm I uns, I sa understand some of it but some of it I find a bit hard to understand like this bit, it says be careful, sometimes the unknown side is is the longest side and sometimes it is not.
But I thi, I I can't, I know that you have to take it away.'

Terence: 'Yes but the thing is this in a right angle triangle'

Adrian: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'the longest side is called what?
Cos it'

Adrian: 'The hypotenuse.'

Terence: 'The hypotenuse, right!
So the longer side is always the hypotenuse.'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'Right?
Now, what is the formula for your Pythagoras theorem?'

Adrian: 'The sum of the erm I do I don't, I know, my dad's taught me a different one to Miss [UNK], she she taught me that erm i the, oh hang on!
It's back here.
[UNK] I got a new book today so but she taught that is was ha!
Erm, if I can find it!
The right angle triangle.
The areas and squares on the two short sides add together to equal the area on the square of the hypotenuse.'

Terence: 'Right!
The square on the hypotenuse'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides.'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'The square on the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides.'

Adrian: 'Okay.'

Terence: 'Alright?'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'And the squ hypotenuse is always the longest side.
It's the side opposite the right angle.'

Adrian: 'Mhm.'

Terence: 'So there's your right angle that is the hypotenuse and the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares, that's the su, the area of that square and the area of that square add together the sum of the squares on the other two sides.'

Adrian: 'Okay.'

Terence: 'Alright?
The square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides.
So what they're saying is this that the square on that side'

Adrian: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'is thirty six, so what's the length of that side?'

Adrian: 'Erm that must be nine.'

Terence: 'No!'

Adrian: 'Sorry!
Aha.
What then?'

Terence: 'The square root of thirty six.
What two numbers amount to [UNK]'

Adrian: 'Six.'

Terence: 'That's right.
So the that side must be six centimetres'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'The square is six times six which is thirty six.
That is four square centimetres.'

Adrian: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'It's four centimetres and the square is sixteen so, what must be the area of that square?'

Adrian: 'Twenty.'

Terence: 'Twenty.
Right!
So you've got to find what number multiplied together makes twenty.'

Adrian: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'So it's going to, the length of that side is going to be the'

Adrian: 'So you square the root of twenty.
Find the square root of twenty don't you?'

Terence: 'You find the square root of twenty.
That's right.
And how do you find the square root of twenty?'

Adrian: 'Just use that.'

Terence: 'You'll use that yes!'

Adrian: 'Mm mm.'

Terence: 'Aren't you lucky?'

Adrian: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'Because I we never had sa we never had erm calculators.'

Adrian: 'Wha what did you have to do then?'

Terence: 'So you had to find the square root of by ar either arithmetic by'

Adrian: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'doing in an arithmetic way or you had to use a sca, a log table.
You had to use log tables.
You had to use this sort of thing like find it [UNK] up in a mess hasn't it?
Erm I had to go to a table like that which said square roots and I had to look up twenty'

Adrian: 'It's got on the back actually.
Back of this book.'

Terence: 'Square roots twe'

Adrian: 'Oh yeah.'

Terence: 'square root is twenty and it's four point four seven two one.'

Adrian: 'Yeah, square root.'

Terence: 'That's right.
But, as you say you can use this'

Terence: 'Which one do you push now?'

Adrian: 'That one.'

Terence: 'That's right.
Four point four seven two.'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'So, you know, that's well the way you do it.
So th that's how you find that.
So now when you got these three here'

Adrian: 'I've done these.'

Terence: 'You've done those have you?'

Adrian: 'Yeah, look.
Here are.'

Terence: 'Well let's see that you got them right shall we?'

Adrian: 'Six five A.'

Terence: 'So, this one you've got twenty five equals nine plus some number.
Right?'

Adrian: 'Mhm.'

Terence: 'So, that is going to be sixteen isn't it?'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'No it isn't.'

Adrian: 'Yes it is!'

Terence: 'Yes it is, sixteen.
So, what's that gonna be?'

Adrian: 'Sixteen to erm, square root of sixteen'

Terence: 'Sixteen'

Adrian: 'is four.'

Terence: 'Four.
So that's'

Terence: 'gonna be four.
So, C five A, have you got four?'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'Yes you have.
Right.
Now, B again, that the square root of that is going to equal the square root of that plus the square root of that.
So you've got sixteen'

Adrian: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'Or rather, sixty four e eighty one equals sixty four plus some number.
So, sixty four from eighty one'

Adrian: 'Gives you six which is erm, seventeen so it's'

Terence: 'Gives you'

Adrian: 'er seventeen.'

Terence: 'Gives you seventeen.
So now, for the answer to that one'

Adrian: 'The square root of seventeen.'

Terence: 'you want the square root of seventeen which is four point one two.
Right!'

Adrian: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'So C again, you've got eleven elevens, what are eleven elevens?'

Adrian: 'Er a hundred and twenty one.'

Terence: 'A hundred and twenty one equals thirty six, plus some number.'

Adrian: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'So what is a hundred and twenty one less thirty six?'

Adrian: 'Erm er is it six erm erm si'

Terence: 'Eighty five.'

Adrian: 'eighty five, sorry.'

Terence: 'Have you got eighty five?
The square root of eighty five?
Yes, you have!
Er, the square root of eighty five, that sounds reasonable so I would assume that's right.
D you've got sixty four equals'

Adrian: 'Mhm.'

Terence: 'twenty five plus some number, so what's that?
Thirty nine?'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'The square root of thirty nine which is obviously reasonable so that's alright.
Right!
So how's'

Adrian: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'C six?
And you can't do C six?'

Adrian: 'So that, those are alright?'

Terence: 'Yes, you can mar, well yes you can do.'

Adrian: 'They're wrong, aren't they?
I'll mark them right.'

Terence: 'Why don't you tick it neatly?'

Adrian: 'I do!'

Terence: 'As I've said before!
You don't.'

Adrian: 'Okay then.'

Terence: 'No, it's alright!
Leave'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'it now but erm'

Adrian: 'Oh that's alright?'

Terence: 'that's, you know, you should erm Okay!
So you're going to do C six.
I will do them while you do them.'

Adrian: 'Okay.'

Terence: 'Cos I'

Adrian: 'Is that the hypotenuse?
Yes?'

Terence: 'Which is the hypotenuse?'

Adrian: 'That one?'

Terence: 'Which one?'

Adrian: 'The opposite one to the right angle.'

Terence: 'Right.'

Adrian: 'So it's that one.'

Terence: 'Right!'

Adrian: 'So, so it must be it is erm can I write it down on here?'

Terence: 'I'll tell you what write it down on paper and then you can copy it into your book when you know you've got it right.
How about that?'

Adrian: 'Hang on a sec!
Five point three nine.'

Terence: 'Right!
I'll settle for that.'

Adrian: 'Is that right, the way I've done it?
By the way, I I did that so I did area of square along the side.'

Terence: 'Well I mean you've got the right answer so erm'

Adrian: 'Shall I just write shall I copy it in?'

Terence: 'Yes, what have you done?'

Adrian: 'Erm five equals twenty five mm?'

Terence: 'Five doesn't equal twenty five.'

Adrian: 'Five fives are twenty five!'

Terence: 'You haven't got five times, you've got five equals twenty five.
Five square equals twenty five!'

Adrian: 'That's what I've been doing I meant I mean that!'

Terence: 'Yahhh But if you write that look!
Five equals twenty five is not true!
Five squared equals twenty five yes!'

Adrian: 'Okay then.'

Terence: 'Right?'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'Be very precise.
But you shouldn't ever write five equals twenty five cos it doesn't!'

Adrian: 'Okay then.'

Terence: 'You mean five squared, you mean five times five equals twenty five you're looking for five squared, so that's the right thing to write!
Alright?'

Adrian: 'Okay.
That is the hypotenuse isn't it?
That there?'

Terence: 'Yes.
Mhm.'

Adrian: 'C Do you do ninety nine take twenty five?'

Terence: 'Which one are we doing?'

Adrian: 'B.
Erm I'm gonna do'

Terence: 'What have you got?'

Adrian: 'Er'

Terence: 'You've got you've got nine nines are eighty one, nine squared equals eighty, nine squared equals'

Adrian: 'Ah so'

Terence: 'what?'

Adrian: 'Eighty one equals nine!'

Terence: 'Ah pa cha cha cha cha cha Right.
Five squared equals twenty five right now what have you got to do?'

Adrian: 'Nine into ninety erm eight in eighty one take twenty five.'

Terence: 'That's right.'

Adrian: 'So erm that'll be se fifty five fifty, fifty six.'

Terence: 'Right.'

Adrian: 'So then you square root it?'

Terence: 'That's right.'

Adrian: 'Seven point four eight.'

Terence: 'Right.'

Adrian: 'Is it a hundred take nine?'

Terence: 'That's right.'

## 038002

Adrian: 'Is the last one eight nine four?'

Terence: 'Eight hundred and ninety four?'

Adrian: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'What's the square root of eighty?'

Adrian: 'Eight point nine four two.'

Terence: 'That's better!'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'Right, eight point nine four.
What did you get the other one?'

Adrian: 'Nine point eight O.'

Terence: 'Right.
That's right.
Alright but just wondering why you've got this book.'

Adrian: 'She gave it to us.'

Terence: 'All of you?'

Adrian: 'Yeah.
It's like, we do a bit of it each night and it's over two weeks.
The last bit we did was only the small numbers.
That or wi with that.'

Terence: 'Oh.'

Adrian: 'An an we're just working through it as a class and that.'

Terence: 'Are you?'

Adrian: 'Yeah.
And we didn't we didn't do our booklets this week.'

Terence: 'Well this, you see this is the interesting thing because that hum What's that in?
I've, I've just been dealing with that in a booklet.'

Adrian: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'If I could erm only remember which booklet it was.
Erm That pa that page or was it?
No, perhaps it wasn't a booklet.
Perhaps it wasn't a booklet.
I'm just wondering why, cos someone's been dealing with that'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'just this week.
No!
I can't, I'll have to find it some other time but er right yellow book two, let's have a look yellow book two.
No!
I'll leave it.'

Terence: 'Right!
Er, so now what erm'

Adrian: 'Do you wanna do some erm'

Terence: 'Have you done that booklet?'

Adrian: 'booklet?
This bo, I haven't finished it.'

Terence: 'Erm you, have you done any on it?'

Adrian: 'Yes.'

Terence: 'Right, let's mark what you've done.'

Adrian: 'That goes with that.'

Terence: 'You do this in your school book do you?'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'Right, that's right.
That's right.'

Adrian: 'Shall I tick it?'

Terence: 'Can do if you want.
That's right.'

Adrian: 'Is this all right?'

Terence: 'Well er yes, A five is on the answer is on the erm back cover of your book.'

Adrian: 'Is A four alright?'

Terence: 'A four's alright, yeah.
Now loo, look on the, no no, wait a moment!
Look on the back cover of your booklet inside the back cover.
Right, that's alright.
They're alright.
That's right.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Right.'

Adrian: 'Are they all right?'

Terence: 'Mhm.
Right.'

Adrian: 'Shall we co continue with that or do you want'

Terence: 'You can do if you want.
Is that but you're doing that at school are you as well?'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'Right okay.
So B six.
Er, [UNK] one to mark here.'

Adrian: 'Yep.
This one.'

Terence: 'Well, I think perhaps what we'll do cos you've missed quite a few of these out so I think what we'll do erm is to leave that what you're doing there for a moment we'll go through this mark this and the one's you haven't done we'll do so that you've got this one straight.
Okay?'

Adrian: 'Okay.
There's only one I didn't do.
That one.'

Terence: 'Oh yes!
So there is.
Well, well anyway we'll do do that and see see what the other's like.
You've been caught!
Right!
This one posts are erected at a hundred metre intervals on a motorway, how many posts are there in a distance of four thousand seven hundred kilometres?'

Adrian: 'Twenty seven.'

Terence: 'No.
As I say, you have been caught in a little trap!
Posts are erected'

Adrian: 'Forty sev six posts.'

Terence: 'posts are erected every hundred metres, right?'

Adrian: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'There's a hundred metres there's two hundred metres there's three hundred metres how many posts in three hundred metres?'

Adrian: 'Four.
Sorry!'

Terence: 'Mm.'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'Right.
Because at no metres there's one post and at the end of a hundred metres you've got two posts so you got one post more'

Adrian: 'So it must be forty six.'

Terence: '[UNK] distance.'

Adrian: 'That's what I say, forty eight.'

Terence: 'Forty eight right!
Got it?
Always'

Adrian: 'Okay.'

Terence: 'be wary of that.
And the same thing applies posts are a hundred metres apart.'

Adrian: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'If you are at the fifth post how far have you gone from the start?'

Adrian: 'Six hundred metres.'

Terence: 'How far have you gone from the start?'

Adrian: 'Four hundred.'

Terence: 'Right!
Fifth post, one, two, three, four, five the fifth post you have gone four hundred metres.'

Adrian: 'Oh.'

Terence: 'So wherever you get that sort of question just stop and think'

Adrian: 'Okay.'

Terence: 'because it's either one more or it's one less.
The only time that that doesn't apply is if you are thinking in terms of posts in a fence around a square field or round a circular field.'

Adrian: 'Okay.'

Terence: 'Because now after one hundred metres you've got two posts after two hundred metres you've got three posts, after three hundred metres you got four posts, after four hundred metres you've got five posts but after you've five hundred metres you've only got five posts cos that one doubles up.'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'So you got one, two, three, four, five spaces and you got one, two, three, four, five, posts'

Adrian: 'Mhm.'

Terence: 'but on a straight line your'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'spaces are one less than the number of posts.
Alright?'

Adrian: 'Okay.'

Terence: 'So just remember that.
That's why I said you have been caught!
That's a ste, one of those little trap questions.'

Adrian: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'Now this one, four hedges together have a mass of two hundred grams how many have a mass of two and ha?'

## 038003

Terence: 'Which page?
Eighty two.
Found that quickly didn't you?
Er percentages is it?'

Danielle: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'Right.
E one.
Have you looked at this?
Let's have a look at it.
B's height is sixty percent of A side.
There's B and it's sixty percent of A C's height is a hundred and twenty percent of A's height.
There's a hundred percent so a hundred and twenty it means it's more than A's height.
If C's height was a hundred percent of A's height it means it was exactly the same.
If it's less than a hundred it's smaller if it's more than a hundred it's greater.
Now the decimal equivalent of hundred and twenty is one point two and there you've got nought and nought a hundred and one so ninety percent is point nine, eighty percent is point eight and a hundred and ten percent is one point one, and a hundred and twenty percent is one point two.
So what you're doing, in fact is to if you've got a hundred and twenty percent if you divide that by of a hundred in other words, you move your decimal point two places that's a decimal.
So a hundred and twenty percent as a decimal fraction is one point two.
All you do is to move that decimal point two places.
Alright?
So to calculate a hundred and twenty percent of amount to calculate a hundred and twenty percent of an amount you multiply by one point two.
If you wanted to calculate eighty percent of an amount you would multiply by point eight.
A hundred and twenty percent you are multiplying by the decimal equivalent which is one point two.
So write down decimal equivalent of a hundred and forty percent.
That's right.
Now calculate a hundred and forty percent of seven point five kilogrammes.
Have you got a, you've got a calculator haven't you?
Haven't got it with you?'

Danielle: 'No.'

Terence: 'But you've got your own?
Scientific one?
No?'

Danielle: 'No.'

Terence: 'You could do with one.
Alright?
It's one of those things that you could do with really.
If you've got a birthday or something coming up and if somebody wants to know what to buy you that's what you want!
You want one of these scientific ones.
So, you want a hundred and forty percent of seven point five.'

Terence: 'Let's have a look.
What is it?
A hundred and forty percent, so it's one point four times seven point five.
Try it.
Use that one.
Yes you use your finger [UNK].
One point four times'

Danielle: 'Oh it's [UNK].'

Terence: 'Ten point five, that's right.
Okay.
Ten point five killogrammes.
Right!
Put it on the, on the er on that desk which probably will be better.
So, alright calculate a hundred and thirty percent of sixty seven pounds.
That's right, a, what is that?'

Danielle: 'Eighty seven point nine.'

Terence: 'Yeah, so it's eighty seven pounds ten isn't it?
That's right.
Right, B a hundred and twenty percent off thirty two metres?'

Danielle: 'Oops!'

Terence: 'No.
Start again.
Right, one point two metres times thirty two.
Yeah?
What is it?'

Danielle: 'Thirty eight point four.'

Terence: 'That's right!
Now, a hundred and eighty percent of seventy four metres?'

Danielle: 'One three three eight two.'

Terence: 'That's right.
Right!
E three A.
What are the decimal equivalents of a hundred and sixty percent?
That's right.
A hundred and sixty three percent?'

Danielle: 'Six six four.'

Terence: 'Yeah, point six three.
Good!
You move that decimal point you see, in two places and it's one point three.
A hundred and six percent?'

Danielle: 'One point nought six.'

Terence: 'That's right!
One point nought six.
Again, yo you, the figure staying the same, all you do is to move a decimal point two places.
So D is'

Danielle: 'One point three nine.'

Terence: 'One point three nine.
Alright.
And E?'

Danielle: 'One point nine.'

Terence: 'One point nine [UNK] or one point nine, yes.
Right!
A factory plans to increase it's output by fifty percent next year.
So if this stands for this year's output at a hundred percent fifty percent of it has to be added on to give next year's.
So there's your hundred percent and you add fifty percent.
So next year's output is to be a hundred and fifty percent of this year's.
Because you add fifty percent to the hundred percent and a hundred plus fifty is a hundred and fifty.
So the output is going to be a hundred and fifty percent of what is was last year.
The decimal equivalent of a hundred and fifty percent is one point five O or one point five.
Next year's output is to be one point five times this year's.
So you multiply this year's output by one point five and it'll give you next year's output.
Alright?
You add on that fifty percent or whatever it happens to be to the hundred percent which gives you the new figure.
You change that into a decimal that is what you multiply by.
So, let's have a look.
If something is increased by fifty percent it is multiplied by one point five.
A new town plans to increase it's population by fifty percent during the next five years.
If the present population is eighty three percent calculate the planned population in five years time.
So what are you gonna multiply that by?'

Danielle: 'One point five.'

Terence: 'Right!
So it's eighty three thousand and what do you get?'

Danielle: 'One two four five O O.'

Terence: 'That's right.
One hundred and twenty four thousand five hundred.
Now, calculate the new populations when these populations are increased by fifty percent?
Now, you can give the answer in this form you needn't write it out in full.
So, what you're gonna do is to multiply sixty four point eight by'

Danielle: 'Haven't got anything.'

Terence: 'one point five and that'll give you an answer which you will write down followed by the word million.
Alright?
So, sixty four point eight multiplied by one point five'

Danielle: 'Ninety seven point two.'

Terence: 'Right!
Ninety seven point two.
Good!
Now this one.'

Danielle: 'That's fifty eight point eight.'

Terence: 'A fifty eight point eight million.
And C?'

Danielle: 'Eighty nine point seven million.'

Terence: 'That's right!
Okay.
An airline is to increase all it's fares by seventeen percent.
Now this erm illustrates the increase.
There's your hundred percent it's got to go up by one point seven to a hundred and seventeen percent.
One hundred and seventeen is one point one seven.
So you multiply your hundred by one point one seven and you get one hundred and seventeen.
The new fare is one hundred and seventeen percent of the old fare.
The decimal equivalent of a hundred and seventeen percent is one point one seven.
Move two decimal yo decimal points down those two places, alright?
So to get the new fare you multiply the old fare by one point one seven.
The old fare multiplied by one point one seven gives you the new fare.
That represents a seventeen percent increase.
So at three, before the seventeen the percent increase the fare from London to Feraccas was five hundred and fifty pounds calculate the new fare after the increase.'

Danielle: 'Six O three point five.'

Terence: 'Right!
So that's six hundred and forty three pounds fifty pence'

Danielle: 'Fifty.'

Terence: 'isn't it?
Right!
F four.
If you want to increase something by forty five percent what do you multiply it by?'

Danielle: 'Four point five.'

Terence: 'One if you're increasing it by forty five percent if it was a hundred percent and you increase it by forty five hundred percent'

Danielle: 'Oh it'll be nought point'

Terence: 'No.
A hundred percent plus forty five percent will be what?'

Danielle: 'A hundred and forty'

Terence: 'A hundred and forty'

Danielle: 'five.'

Terence: 'five percent.
Right?
Now what's that of a decimal equivalent?'

Danielle: 'One point four five.'

Terence: 'Right!
Alright?
So, if you want to increase something by forty five percent what do you multiply it by?'

Danielle: 'One point erm'

Terence: 'four five.
Think in terms of putting a one in front of that and then moving a decimal point two places and it's one point four five.
So okay, F four A is one point four five.
Alright?
That's the first, that's your answer to that first question.
F four A was one point four five.
Now it says No!
Just one point four five.'

Danielle: 'Oh yeah.'

Terence: 'A hundred and forty five percent is one point four five, alright?
So now it says increase twenty eighty pounds by forty five percent.
So you're gonna multiply the twenty eight by?'

Danielle: 'One point four five.'

Terence: 'Right!
Forty point six.'

Danielle: 'Forty pounds sixty, right.
Right!
Right!
F five, now all of these you've got to increase e something by something there so you've got to change each of those percentages you've got to think of it as added to a hundred and then the decimal equivalent.
So what are you gonna multiply the sixty seven by?'

Danielle: 'One point six two.'

Terence: 'One point six two.
Right!
Good!'

Danielle: 'One O eight point five four.'

Terence: 'That's right, one O eight point five four and it is in killogrammes.
That's right.
Right.
Right!
So F six A.
If you want to increase something by seven percent what do you multiply it by?'

Danielle: 'Er nought point seven.'

Terence: 'Sorry?
Say it again.'

Danielle: 'Nought seven, one point nought seven.'

Terence: 'Yeah, one point nought seven, that's right!
So your ar answer to A is one point nought seven.
Good!
So now you increase sixty five pounds by seven percent.'

Danielle: 'Sixty nine point thirty five.'

Terence: 'Sixty nine pound thirty five pence.
Right!
Good!
Okay, now F seven's gonna be the same.
Increase ninety two pounds by three percent.
That's right.
Nine pound four seventy six.
Good!
Right.
That's right.
Good!
Right!
Alfred's salary is eighty thousand four hundred and twenty pounds and Alberta's is seven thousand a hundred and eighty four Alfred has a twenty two percent increase and Alberta a thirty eighty percent increase who earns more after all this?
So what you've got to do is to put down Alfred's Alfred and put his new salary down and then you have to Alberta and her new salary and see which is which is the most.
So you're going to look for'

Danielle: 'Oh, tell me again!'

Terence: 'Alright.
So'

Danielle: 'Oh.'

Terence: 'so right, eighty four two nought multiplied by'

Danielle: 'Erm'

Terence: 'eight that's right.
So what's that, ten two seven two forty?
Yeah.
Put a, put the forty down cos it's forty pence.
Right!
Yep!
That's good!
Now, Alberta's.
Right!
So, earns more afterwards?'

Danielle: 'Alfred.'

Terence: 'Right!
So Alfred is the answer.
Right!
Oh, we're coming to negative numbers.
Have we done negative numbers?'

Danielle: 'No.'

Terence: 'No.
Right.
Positive, negative numbers can be marked on a number line which extends in both directions.
You can do some simple calc calculations by thinking of a number line, for example, two, minus two, plus five means start at minus two then go up five so you'll finish at three.
So minus two, plus five equals'

Danielle: 'Three.'

Terence: 'plus three.
Right?
Minus three, minus two means start at minus three then go down minus two, so minus three and minus two is minus five.
Alright?
Now, before you right them down just tell me what they are and then we can go back and write them down.
Here you've got, minus four and plus three.'

Danielle: 'That's minus one.'

Terence: 'Good!
Minus four and plus six?'

Danielle: 'Two.'

Terence: 'Plus two, right.
Yes, two, yeah okay.
So write them down cos yo you obviously can do those alright.'

Danielle: 'It's plus two minus one [UNK]'

Terence: 'Minus one, yeah.'

Danielle: 'Minus'

Terence: 'It's two.'

Danielle: 'Yeah, two.'

Terence: 'Now two minus five?'

Danielle: 'Minus three.'

Terence: 'Minus three.
Minus one minus three?'

Danielle: 'Minus four.'

Terence: 'Right!
Minus six plus two.'

Danielle: 'Minus four.'

Terence: 'Right.
And three minus eight?'

Danielle: 'Minus five.'

Terence: 'Right!
The number line method works when you have to add or subtract and ordinary positive number plus three means go up three, minus three means go down three.
But it does not tell you how to do four plus minus three or seven minus, minus three, for example but it does not tell you how to do four plus minus three, or seven minus minus three where you have to add or subtract a negative number.
Adding a negative number.
Think what happens if you start with four and add on different numbers.
Four plus three, as the number you add on goes down so the answer goes down.
Four plus three equals seven four plus two equals six, four plus one five, four plus nothing equals four, four plus minus one is three cos you're coming down here, three two, one, nought, minus one, minus two, minus three, minus four, minus five.
So as the numbers that you add on get one less so the answers get one less.
So, four plus minus one is three, four plus minus two is two, four plus minus three is one, four plus minus four is nothing, four plus minus five is minus one.
What is important is that you realise that that number is minus one that number is one plus one if you like but you don't need to say it but if th any, if the sign isn't there it's assumed that it's plus.
But that number and that number are two different numbers.
They're as different as one is from three.
That is a different number from that, that is a different number from that.
And that number is minus one.
Don't think of it as taking away one thinking of it, think of it as minus one, a number.
That is minus two that is minus three that is minus four, that is minus five.
You've done some algebra haven't you?
Found out the value of X well you can X equals minus five.
And that is a value for X, it equals minus five and minus five is a number.
So, try and remember that, that that is a number in it's own right.
Now when you start thinking of what to do you've got plus four and you've got minus three if you take the smaller digit, now that digit is four, that digit is three if you take the smaller digit from the larger digit, you take the three from the four you get one and the answer is whatever sign that larger number is.
When you've got two numbers that are both, all pluses, four and two is six, four and one is five, four and nothing is four, four and minus one means you got plus four minus one, is one less than four, it's three.
You've got four plus numbers, you got two minus numbers which leaves you with two plus numbers.
Let's go on and see whether you can pick it up.
Write down the next two lines of a pattern of the bottom of the opposite page.
Notice that four plus minus one has the same answer as four minus one.
Four plus minus two has the same answer as four minus two and so on because the plus and minus gives you a minus.
So we've got four plus minus one is three, four plus minus two is two, four plus minus three is one, four plus minus four is nought, four plus minus five is minus one what's going to be the next one?
Four plus'

Danielle: 'Minus six'

Terence: 'Equals?'

Danielle: 'makes minus two.'

Terence: 'Right!
So write that down in your book now safely.
A is A two, write down the next two lines.
So you got four plus minus six is minus two, then you'll have four plus minus seven is gonna be?
Minus three.
Right!
Okay?
So let's go on.
Adding minus N is the same as subtracting N adding the minus number is the same as subtracting it.
So copy and complete these.
So write down A three A.
Five plus minus three equals five minus three equals?'

Danielle: 'Two.'

Terence: 'Two.
Right!
Two plus minus six is the same as two minus six which is going to be?
You got plus two minus six'

Danielle: 'Four.'

Terence: 'Mm?'

Danielle: 'Four.'

Terence: 'You take the smaller digit from the larger digit so you take the two'

Danielle: 'Eight.'

Terence: 'from the six and it gives you four but then you give the sign of a larger'

Terence: 'so it's minus four.
Alright?
Now this is minus three plus minus four which is the same as minus three minus four.
Now you can, those are both the same sides so you're gonna en add them together and give it the sign that is common to both.'

Danielle: 'Minus six.'

Terence: 'Minus?'

Danielle: 'Six?'

Terence: 'Three and four?'

Danielle: 'Seven, sorry!'

Terence: 'So, alright?
Minus seven, yeah?
Happy?
Right, so A four, work these out.
Now if you can do them then just put the answer down.
Six plus minus three is the same as six plus and a minus give you a minus, so it's the same as six minus three which is?
What's six minus three?'

Danielle: 'Three.'

Terence: 'Three!
Right!
You take the smaller digit from the larger digit, so you take three from six gives you three you give the sign of the bigger number which is a plus.
Now this time you've got two minus five.'

Danielle: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'You take the two, the smaller digit from the larger digit but you give the answer the sign of a larger digit.
So it's?'

Danielle: 'Minus'

Terence: 'Minus three!
Alright?
Yeah?
Okay, you got minus one and a minus four.'

Danielle: 'Minus four.'

Terence: 'No, you got a minus one and a minus four they're both the same signs, cos it's minus one, minus four they're both the same signs so you put them together four and one make?'

Danielle: 'Five?'

Terence: 'And you've got'

Danielle: 'Minus one.'

Terence: 'minus, so they're minus five.
Let's just have a look at if we've got six and four we can have six plus four or you can have six minus four we can have minus six, minus four or you can have minus six plus four.
Now that's a plus six and a plus four what's the answer?'

Danielle: 'Ten.'

Terence: 'Ten.
Nice and straightforward.
Both the signs are the same.
So you add them together and you give it the same sign.
This one what's the answer to that gonna be?
You've got a minus six and a minus four.
Both the same signs.'

Danielle: 'Ten.'

Terence: 'Can't be the same as that.
They're both minus.
Those are both plus so we call it plus ten these are both minus so the answer is?'

Danielle: 'Ten.'

Terence: 'Minus ten.
Alright?
If the signs are the same you add them together, you give the ssssa the sign that they're both the same as.
Now, here you've got six minus four now what's six minus four?'

Danielle: 'Two.'

Terence: 'So that equals two.
Now here you got minus six plus four take the smaller from the larger and give it the sign of a larger.'

Danielle: 'Minus two.'

Terence: 'Right!
Does that help a little bit?
Let's do another one.
Let's do erm eight plus three eight minus three minus eight, minus three, and minus eight plus three.
Let's see if we can do those.
What's eight and three?'

Danielle: 'Eleven.'

Terence: 'Right.
What's minus eight and minus three?'

Danielle: 'Minus nine.'

Terence: 'No!
Minus eight and minus three?
Both the same signs.'

Danielle: 'Minus eleven.'

Terence: 'Minus eleven.
Now this is easy, eight minus three is?'

Danielle: 'Five.'

Terence: 'Five.
But this is a minus eight'

Danielle: 'That's five, yes.'

Terence: 'plus three, it's minus five.
Alright?
Tear that out and keep that by your side because that gives you all the four possibilities.
Alright?
When the signs are the same if they're two pluses you add them and it's plus if they're both minus you add them and it's minus here you take the smaller from the larger and give it the sign of a larger.
Three from eight is five, that's plus five.
Three from eight is five, but that is minus, so it's gonna be minus five.
Okay?
So keep that by your side and see how we get on.
So we've what were we doing?
A B D!
This one here is it?
Minus two plus minus five.
Which is minus two minus five.
Minus two plus the minus gives you a minus, so you got minus two, minus five.'

Danielle: 'Er, minus seven.'

Terence: 'Minus seven.
Right!
Now here you've got nought and a plus minus gives you a minus, so it's nought a minus four?'

Danielle: 'Minus three.'

Terence: 'Right!
Good!
Three minus three?
Three'

Danielle: 'Nought.'

Terence: 'minus three.'

Danielle: 'Nought.'

Terence: 'Nought, right!
Minus five minus two?'

Danielle: 'Minus three.
Erm'

Terence: 'Minus and a minus.
Same as that one, look.
Minus two, minus five.
You got that one right.
What was that?
Minus two and minus five.'

Danielle: 'Seven.'

Terence: 'Is minus seven.
Right?
So here you got minus five, minus two which is?'

Danielle: 'Minus seven.'

Terence: 'Minus seven.
Now here you got seven minus nine?
Take the smaller from the larger which will give you?
Seven'

Go by plane!
But when you go by coach you you realise why you go by plane, you know!'

Richard: 'That's right, right.'

Terence: 'and you can turn over one way or you can turn over the other way.'

Richard: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'And it was really, it was very good!

Margaret: 'with this last ball really.'

Terence: 'Well, yeah.'

Margaret: 'This red one.'

Terence: 'If he gets another red he's won the match.

Margaret: 'Oh not just, not just one ball he needs to play'

Terence: 'Yes.'

Margaret: 'but two.'

Terence: 'He needs two.
Thompson didn't play his.

Or did I put it in this one?
No I didn't.
You must have picked it up.'

Margaret: 'What do you mean I must have picked it up?'

Terence: 'Well because I put it in that book.'

Margaret: 'I would never have taken anything out of that book that you had put in because I wouldn't have known what it was about.

Terence: 'Mm?'

Margaret: 'They'll give you a fire if it's cold [UNK] the other day when Tony was here with his mum [UNK] they had a fan heater [UNK]'

Terence: 'Oh.'

Terence: 'Well it'll probably be alright, it's not so cold today actually.'

Terence: 'Good morning Muriel.'

Lucy: '[UNK] they missed it last week but it's supposed to be correct.
You know, they counted it but they missed putting it in.'

Terence: 'So do we count it, do we put it?'

Lucy: 'It wasn't counted in last week's at all.'

Terence: 'It wasn't counted in?'

Lucy: 'No, so'

Terence: 'Nocturnal.'

Margaret: 'Nocturnal, yes.

Terence: 'Put them over here look and that that's it.'

Margaret: 'Cos there was only one collection yesterday wasn't there?
Aren't we the lucky ones today.'

Margaret: 'I think we've only had one for ages and ages.'

Margaret: 'Oh we [UNK]'

Terence: 'You want to come you want to come to St Gregory's.'

Margaret: 'If there isn't a collection though, an official one, they'll have one of their own for the [UNK]'

Margaret: 'I think the Bishop's cutting out the [UNK]'

Margaret: 'He cut them down, that's right, yes, yes.
Quite right.
Quite right.'

Margaret: 'Now, what was I going to do?
Oh'

Terence: 'The envelopes?'

Margaret: '[UNK] before the envelopes [UNK].'

Terence: 'Fancy, you wouldn't believe that they'd miss that would you?'

Margaret: 'This got missed out?'

Terence: 'This got missed out apparently.'

Terence: 'Well they say it's alright, I I think I shall probably check it.'

## 039009

Margaret: 'Well we keep on trying Father we don't get a lot of encouragement, I mean you're only having one collection on Sunday nowadays.'

Holly: 'Do you want two?'

Terence: 'Erm we went I went into the hall and saw that fire.
Erm, would erm Mr [UNK] sort of look after it and, you know, cos, would he be responsible for it do you think?
Because it's, the school children go in there as well you see and that's a little bit of a worry but, but if they don't use it it'd be alright.
But you know I'm just wondering what would happen when erm'

Holly: 'You see the, the elderly people on a Sunday morning who go in there and there's some, some rather'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Holly: 'disabled people and, and it's very cold in there.'

Terence: 'They're too cold.
Well, wh you know, wh what happens when the cylinder goes?
Do you think he would erm know what'

Holly: '[UNK] pay out of the parish I suppose.'

Terence: 'Mm?
No well I mean I can pay for it, it's just a question of getting it and sort of erm only we're not often here on a Sunday, if Mr [UNK] is here, is it [UNK]'

Holly: 'He's not.'

Terence: 'He's not.'

Holly: '[UNK] he goes with Father [UNK].
Not Father [UNK], to erm er erm [UNK] that place?
Ashburton.'

Terence: 'Ashburton.'

Holly: 'You see there, there was a er not paying for it, asking about it, the finance committee [UNK] how very cold it was for the elderly and they sit in there while some get taken home and'

Margaret: '[UNK] Doris, you're quite elderly aren't you?
I'm very elderly, my husband's very elderly, we manage very well.'

Holly: 'Well yes but you tell them that will you?'

Holly: 'And they'll tell you to go to hell'

Holly: 'if you tell them that.'

Margaret: 'Well I'm on my way there anyway you see [UNK]'

Holly: 'But no I mean that's not nice to say that because there are cripples'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Holly: 'and people who just people'

Margaret: 'But some people feel the cold more than others.'

Holly: 'who er yeah and'

Margaret: 'Don't they?'

Holly: 'there's very few going in to coffee because of the cold in the'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Holly: 'hall, it is a very cold [UNK]'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Margaret: 'Well when we have our meeting'

Terence: 'Well it's just a question of really of, of some if someone can, you know, I mean'

Margaret: 'Are you going to put a new fire in or something?'

Holly: 'No no we've [UNK] we, we were talking about it actually, what we've done and erm of course it's the school children we've gotta think about'

Margaret: 'Cos we have our meetings [UNK]'

Holly: 'There's nowhere to put it away is there?
It'll slide on th on castors.'

Terence: 'It'll slide on ca I mean I moved it into the corner so that erm'

Holly: 'Yeah is there anywhere that it can be put away when the children are not there?
Or when the children are there.'

Terence: 'Well I mean the children, I mean if I go into the school and I, and say to them look there is a fire there but, you know, please will you not use it but it's just a question of whether the children fiddle with it really, that's'

Holly: 'We'll have to think about it this week while they're away, they're on holiday this week.'

Terence: 'Yes they are, that's true.
But it's also a question of, you know, erm when it's exhausted'

Holly: 'Yeah well we can always arrange that.'

Terence: 'Yeah.
But I'll talk to you some time about the heating because I mean the trouble is that no'

Holly: 'Well er er the whole thing, the, the hall is, is, is a big worry because they won't insure us [UNK] because it's dangerous.
There's no insurance on that hall to my knowledge there's no insurance.'

Terence: 'I didn't know that.'

Holly: 'Michael said to me, the first thing he said to me when I came here, that's the first I'd do, knock it down he said, it's, it's dangerous it's not [UNK].
That's what he said, the first thing he said to me when I came here.
That's, that's the first job you've gotta do, get that, rid of that.'

Terence: 'So there's no point in spending a lot of money on it?'

Holly: 'No that's what I say and, and I've written to the insurer [UNK] to the insurer to tell, ask them what is the situation and we're still waiting an answer.'

Terence: 'I see.'

Margaret: 'But we, didn't we [UNK]'

Terence: 'I thought, I mean I, the fire people gave it the all clear.'

Terence: 'Erm and with, and with the erm with those fan heaters in there, there is as it were, no fire risk from it.'

Holly: 'No.
Well fan heaters can be on you know but you can't hear, feel them unless you're next to them I think.'

Terence: 'Mm mm.
And the overhead heaters were no use either, I mean that's why we put the fan heaters in cos they were better than the'

Holly: 'Well let me wait, I'll tell, I'll sh I'll tell you what the insurers say when they come back, when it comes.
I'm waiting for them to answer.'

Terence: 'Right.'

Holly: 'But it's not insured I can tell you that.
I have no erm er policy for it.
And I've, I was, I don't know if it was Michael or somebody else told me that they wouldn't insure it.'

Margaret: 'Oh [UNK] well we've never known that have we?'

Terence: 'No we've never known that, haven't heard that.'

Holly: 'Well that's, well there's no'

Margaret: 'Cos it was sort of insured when we first took it over.'

Holly: 'Yeah, there's no record of an insurance in the, the file.'

Margaret: 'Oh I see.'

Holly: 'And so I, we have written to them and waiting for an answer.'

Terence: 'Right.'

Holly: 'So when we, you see there's no good putting anything in there erm or doing anything with it if we're not going to use it or if it's gotta come down in another year or two.'

Terence: 'No.'

Holly: 'Mind you when I said it's gotta come down it might be five years before it comes down, but you've gotta think of your outlay first.'

Terence: 'Yeah I mean there's no point in re-roofing it for instance.'

Holly: 'Oh no.
Not as, as far as I know.
But we'll see what they say.'

Margaret: 'Is the insurance through the diocese Father?'

Holly: 'Well it's, it's done it's a di er no'

Margaret: 'No.'

Holly: 'it's done privately but it's, the diocese have appointed the insurers.'

Margaret: 'I see.'

Holly: 'We're done through Peter [UNK]'

Margaret: 'Mhm.'

Holly: 'he's the insurance broker and it all works through Norwich Union.'

Margaret: 'Mhm.'

Holly: 'Erm and he's got some very good quotes for us'

Margaret: 'Yes.'

Holly: 'you don't er insure a building according to its size now but according to the number of people who use it.
It's far er fairer.'

Terence: 'Mm.'

Holly: 'I mean you might have a massive building [UNK]'

Terence: 'And hardly anybody using it.'

Holly: 'you've gotta pay for it.'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Holly: 'So it's according to the number of people that use it, go to mass, how much you pay'

Terence: 'Mm.'

Holly: 'erm on the insurance.
And it covers everything but as far as I know, and I'm willing to be corrected'

Terence: 'Yeah I don't know.'

Holly: 'that, that is not insured.'

Margaret: 'No well we don't know, we had thought that it was.
Especially after'

Holly: 'No as far as'

Margaret: 'it was all done up.'

Terence: 'Mm.'

Margaret: 'Yes [UNK] after it was sort of'

Holly: 'Well as far as well I know that Michael'

Margaret: 'renovated.'

Holly: 'Michael said to me, the first thing he said to me, that has to come down.'

Margaret: 'How funny, he never ever said anything like that to us.
You've not heard that either?'

Margaret: '[UNK] told me.'

Holly: 'That's the first thing, I know nothing about, no well I know nothing about structure or anything else, you know I mean'

Margaret: 'But they had I don't know if you know it had been absolutely dilapidated, the hall, I mean it was absolutely run down and it wasn't used.
But then there was this erm er er what was it called?
The scheme er er to help'

Margaret: 'The scheme, the youth scheme and er [UNK]'

Terence: 'The [UNK]'

Margaret: 'youngsters'

Terence: 'Oh'

Margaret: 'so that if [UNK]'

Terence: 'The work, work something something scheme and and they, they'd refurbish it, all th th that we had to do was to pay for the materials, they provided the labour.
And in fact, you know, I mean they er they made it'

Holly: 'Well it looks alright to me.'

Terence: 'they made it useful again.'

Holly: 'But if I, if I'

Terence: 'Usable.'

Margaret: 'if I had anything to do with it, I would like those, those gas fires that we've got in the room at the back of the church there, they're ideal.'

Terence: 'The trouble is there'

Margaret: 'The trouble is there's'

Terence: 'no mains gas'

Margaret: 'there's no gas.'

Terence: 'into the hall.'

Holly: 'No well'

Terence: 'That is why we didn't, we would of liked to have had it but the cost to put the mains gas in was going to be so enormous'

Holly: 'Oh well'

Terence: 'and the electric supply is limited to the heating that we've got, we can't put any more in because the mains supply again is not sufficient.'

Holly: 'This is amazing because in Cornwall they would put in the gas for nothing.'

Terence: 'Well I mean, you know, I mean'

Holly: 'Cos we had it done in our hall.'

Margaret: '[UNK] they are now, perhaps if you had a word with them'

Holly: 'We, we we had it in our hall, we, they put it into the building for nothing'

Margaret: 'Yeah'

Holly: 'and then you have to wire erm plumb it in or whatever they call it [UNK]'

Margaret: 'Yes [UNK]'

Terence: 'Yes, that's fair enough.'

Holly: 'but they put it in to the meter in [UNK]'

Terence: 'Well well th this was the problem, it was gonna cost I don't know how many hundreds of pounds just to have the s gas supply put to the hall and we felt that, at that time, we couldn't do it.'

Holly: 'Well I had the one [UNK]'

Margaret: 'Presumably there's no gas here is there?'

Terence: 'There's gas here.'

Holly: 'Yes [UNK]'

Margaret: 'You have got gas here, yes, mhm there's gas [UNK]'

Terence: 'Well that might be that might be worth a a query'

Terence: 'I mean that might be worth a query if the Finance Committee are sort of erm er er worrying about the heating.'

Holly: 'Well well we'll have to see what, what the, what the er insurance man says first'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Margaret: 'Yes mhm.'

Holly: 'but it's a long time pl er term, we've gotta look at it and we've got to do something about it for, for heating if we're going to use it, if we're going to let it or something'

Terence: 'Yeah'

Holly: 'then there's got to be heat in there.'

Margaret: 'Mm.
But you see the rent Father'

Holly: 'We each want the same same thing.'

Margaret: 'the rent of the hall is very cheap.'

Holly: 'Yes, but they'll have to'

Margaret: 'But they have to put fifty pence into the'

Holly: 'Yeah'

Margaret: 'the meter [UNK]'

Holly: 'yeah well [UNK] the gas ones the same [UNK]'

Margaret: 'That's that's fifty pence a [UNK] yes?'

Margaret: 'Mhm mhm'

Holly: 'They have to sort out [UNK]'

Margaret: 'But i i i if you find out about the insurance, see what that is'

Holly: 'Yes [UNK]'

Margaret: 'and then perhaps sort of contact the gas people again and see'

Holly: 'Yes'

Margaret: 'I mean this was, how long ago [UNK]?'

Terence: 'Oh this was seven years ago I suppose.'

Margaret: 'About seven years ago so [UNK]'

Holly: '[UNK] two years ago when I was at [UNK] we had the gas put into the hall.'

Margaret: 'Yeah.'

Holly: 'They didn't charge to put it in.'

Margaret: 'No.
Well it would be worthwhile investigating anyway'

Holly: 'Yeah'

Margaret: 'after we hear about the insurance.'

Holly: '[UNK] find out yeah it's all an ongoing thing'

Margaret: 'Yeah it's all go isn't it?'

Holly: 'Okay then thanks.'

Terence: 'It's good isn't it?'

Terence: 'Well I think so.'

Margaret: 'I thought I was giving you a lift [UNK]'

Margaret: 'Well I, I thought of perhaps, you know, of giving you a lift somewhere.'

## 039203

Terence: 'Oh dear Ian Botham's dream of helping England to victory in his last world cup campaign took thrilling shape in Perth.
Botham inspired England to their nine run win over India with his enthusiasm, experience and will to win.
He was involved in everything, opening the innings, coming back as a runner for Graham Gooch, bowling a match winning spell, holding a vital catch and finally ending the game with a calm run out.
Beefy's presence in the England team was a huge bonus for Gooch.
The big fella is more keyed up than I've seen him for a long time and he is channelling all his energies into one final world cup fling.
Don't ask me how he manages it but there is still an aura about Botham that intimidates even the finest player.'

Terence: 'Indian youngster [UNK] handled England's other bowlers with ease, he looked in tremendous form but when Botham came on and bowled him a harmless straight one, somehow managed to edge it into his pads and nearly played on.
Not that Both would ever admit to bowling a straight one the ball he produced to finally get rid of [UNK] was a gem and it turned the match away from India.'

Margaret: 'The thing about it is, I mean they've all got eat their words now haven't they?
I mean they've all been sort of saying oh well you know it's ridiculous to take him, let him play his panto and then sort of just join'

Terence: 'Mm'

Margaret: 'the thing, I mean everybody's been complaining about that but considering all that he hasn't done bad has he?'

Terence: 'No.
Oh I see I thought, I don't know why, I thought there was two, ta two sort of halves to this world cup but there's not'

Margaret: 'Oh.'

Terence: 'it's, it's just the one table.'

Margaret: 'Oh so they've done what they've got to do [UNK]'

Terence: 'Well no I mean they're each gonna play each other obviously but you see England, New Zealand and Sri Lanka and West Indies have all got two points from one game, Australia, India, Pakistan and Zimbabwe have all lost so they've got no points from one game, South Africa have still to play.
So I should think it's gonna be the top four that will go into a knock out competition or something like that at the end, you know?'

Margaret: 'Yeah.
Yes of course these bookings had to made by the twenty fifth of th of erm February didn't they?'

Terence: 'That's right.
Yes, well the twenty sixth was it?'

Margaret: 'Twenty fifth.'

Terence: 'Well that's'

Margaret: 'Twenty sixth, twenty sixth.'

Terence: 'Yes.
Now that's Wednesday you see so I knew we'd got to do it.'

Margaret: 'Oh so that's Wednesday [UNK] You can even get to the Imperial for two ninety seven pounds per person for five nights.
If you think what the Imperial in Torquay is anyway.'

Terence: 'Yeah.
Oh yes it says [UNK] this is the first world cup the new way of playing the qualifying rounds, this is the first world cup where every team has to play each other and it should mean the best sides make the semi-finals.
Under the old two group format it was very much down to luck as to who you were drawn with, the new system is much better, it allows for the odd hiccup, gives an extra dimension to every game and rewards those teams that perform on the day.'

Margaret: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'It also gives the smaller nations like Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe a crack at all the big boys.
So everybody plays everybody else once'

Margaret: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'and then it's the semi-finals so obviously I should think the top four clubs will go into the knock out.'

Margaret: 'Oh so they hadn't have had that at Woodbridge.
Lavenham they have erm at the Swan there [UNK]'

Well the teabags don't mean anything to us really [UNK]'

Terence: 'Thought you said something about a chicken.'

Margaret: 'Well you may as well give them a ring, you found their number didn't you?'

Margaret: 'Yes the erm coffee is two lots of one eighty nine so that's three seventy eight isn't it?'

Terence: 'Mm.'

Margaret: 'Oh that's lovely, three years ago my sister died leaving a household of two men, my brother-in-law aged eighty and myself approaching retirement age to cope with ourselves, to cope for ourselves.
Er because neither of us could really manage in the kitchen it was not long before we became very tired of having to eat convenience food sad looking old meat pies, dried out chips and heated up frozen vegetables soon palled.
I began to despair in the local press I noticed an advert for an evening class, cookery for men being the young one in the family I plucked up courage and enrolled but it was great, with great apprehension that I went to the first class.
I needn't have worried.
There were twenty of us, other chaps in much the same boat as me, Nancy our tutor was cheerful, down to earth and did not expect us to be cordon bleu cooks.
That course changed my life.
With a mixture of demonstrations, simple methods and constant humour, Nancy taught us to fend for ourselves.
I now have the confidence to tackle almost anything in the kitchen, pies, pastas, cakes, soups, meat dishes, vegetables and bread.
There have been many disasters along the road, Yorkshire puddings you could sole your shoes with, burnt offerings of several varieties, a pat that even my dog wouldn't eat and last Christmas a chocolate log that disintegrated, the proud little Santa on top sinking without trace in a sea of chocolate gunge.
These setbacks however were more than compensated for by the successes.
We still keep meat pies and vegetables in the freezer but only for emergencies and I'm in the third year of the course now.
Oh that's lovely.
He got fifty pounds for writing that in as well.'

Terence: 'Did he really?
Yeah mm'

Margaret: 'I was taking my very independent three year old daughter for a walk and I asked her to hold my hand.
I can hold my own hand thank you came the reply and she did.'

Terence: 'Yeah.
Tell you what, it's gonna be a strange journey up to Woodbridge'

Margaret: 'Mm'

Terence: 'because where all the sort of a route that I reckon I know I, I am not gonna know it all.'

Margaret: 'No.
Oh dear, you'd say this would be me as I was leaving the travel agents I heard a woman say my friend and I want to get away from it all, can you recommend somewhere completely unspoiled with a really nice shopping area.'

Terence: 'Mm ah you're right there.
Somewhere like Trega Mills'

Margaret: 'Oh that's a good idea.'

Terence: 'Good lord'

Margaret: 'Use dampened string when tying up parcels, when the string dries it shrinks and'

Terence: 'It tightens up.'

Margaret: 'makes your parcel more secure. [UNK]'

Terence: 'You know the steep hill at, at erm between Martlesham and Woodbridge, you know as you left Martlesham you went down that steep hill down to the erm the pub at the bottom of the hill where you came out on the [UNK] looks to me as if the new road misses that altogether'

Margaret: 'It goes round it.'

Terence: 'goes round that, goes to the Bealings side of it.
Looks to me'

Margaret: 'real relative.'

Margaret: 'landing ourselves'

Terence: 'That's right.'

Margaret: 'on them so'

Terence: 'Mm'

Margaret: 'we've arranged this five day break.'

Terence: 'But if we have everything ready to leave as soon as I get back from chess and I'll make sure I leave promptly if we can come straight away then, with a bit of luck we'll be on to the M twenty five b by half past four so we might'

Margaret: 'How far round do we have to go on that?'

Terence: 'Practically the whole wa half way round.'

Margaret: 'Do we?
Yeah [UNK]'

Terence: 'About forty miles on it.
It's not a lot further than Gatwick but in the other direction.'

Margaret: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'But it's gonna take us, I mean, what Gatwick took us about three and a half hours didn't it?'

Margaret: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'Well I reckon it's gonna take us three and a half hours to get to the other end, so two and a half hours to it and an hour on it if it's not too bad and then of course we've got to go up from there to Ipswich, Woodbridge but it's dual carriageway all the way now you see.'

Margaret: 'Yeah yeah.'

Terence: 'So I mean it's seventy miles so it should only take us another hour.'

Terence: 'So perhaps four and a half hours, if we don't get held up on the M twenty five, four and a half hours would do so that, if we leave here at two, we could be there, you know, well by seven.'

Margaret: 'So you're going, you will be at three [UNK]'

Terence: 'Quarter past five.'

Margaret: 'What's the time now?
Oh yes erm'

Terence: 'Yeah but you're still erm'

Margaret: 'and you're ch you're charged for it.'

Terence: 'Well you're charged for it from the erm a private call but you're not charged'

Margaret: 'Oh and not from a phone box.'

Terence: 'not from a phone box.'

Margaret: 'Oh well.
Well do you know I never knew this I was recently hit by a car and, although not seriously hurt, I did go to casualty to have some cuts cleaned and an X-ray taken to check I hadn't broken my ankle.
Now I have received a bill for nineteen pounds thirty from the hospital for the treatment I was given.
I thought all treatment was free on the N H S, do I have to pay and they answer no, nor should you have been sent the bill although the hospital was within its rights to make a charge for the emergency treatment fee.
There is a standard charge for immediate treatment given by a doctor or a hospital to any casualty of a road accident.
According to the nineteen eighty eight Road Traffic Act the E T F can be charged only to the driver of the car involved irrespective of who caused the accident.
The hospital should therefore have sent the bill to the driver who will be able to claim for it'

Margaret: '[UNK] insurance [UNK]'

Terence: 'That's right, yeah.'

Margaret: 'All policies must cover [UNK] many insurers will reimburse it [UNK].
Return the bill to the hospital and explain their error then you should hear nothing further about it.
Ah you see here's somebody who's writing about, you know, her part of the erm the interest on an er on erm [UNK] and it says [UNK] and provided you have no other income er that would take you over your personal allowance [UNK] register for [UNK] on the Inland Revenue form R eighty five, interest with no tax deductions.
You can also get this form [UNK] tax office or bank.
If you register immediately you'll benefit from a whole year's worth of tax free interest for what's calculated on April the fifth.
If your building society won't allow you to register you can still apply for a refund of overpaid tax [UNK] financial year.
For details see leaflet one R hundred and eleven, how to claim a repayment of tax from banks and building societies.
So I should go into the tax office and [UNK]'

Terence: 'No I think I think we've got the interest your interest on my buil on the buil'

Margaret: 'Yeah I know you sent that to the building society but I was'

Terence: 'Yeah'

Margaret: 'just thinking then of the other'

Terence: 'Oh that tax credit, yeah.'

Margaret: 'Yeah.
[UNK] the, the tax office and ask them'

Terence: 'Oh yeah, could do that if you don't get, hear from the'

Margaret: '[UNK] I should have heard from them by now.'

Terence: 'I would have thought so, yeah.'

Terence: 'Didn't you say somewhere in St Austell?'

Margaret: 'No no no no, I've seen one since then.'

Terence: 'Oh.'

Margaret: 'Bearing in mind too that as a non-taxpayer you can open an account in just your name and so enable all the interest to be declared gross.
[UNK] do you?'

Terence: 'Well it's neither here nor there but I mean the thing is that we don't as it is we're not losing anything because you're getting yours, half of it's coming back as, as gross interest.'

Right so B one up to now speeds have been in metres per second we also use miles per hour M P H or M I H and kilometres per hour, K M H or K M P H'

Lucy: 'If the car has a constant speed of fifty miles per hour this means it goes fifty miles in every hour.'

Terence: 'Right?'

Terence: 'Venice is in Italy.'

Lucy: 'Oh yeah it is.'

Terence: 'Vienna is the capital of Austria'

Lucy: 'Oh!'

Terence: 'and it's right across the other side of Austria from us.
Where you went skiing is this side of Austria, but Vienna is about two hundred and two hundred and fifty miles further on across Austria, very close to erm Czechoslovakia and erm Yugoslavia.
Right so it is twelve hundred and fifty kilometres from London to Vienna, can a Concorde do the trip in half an hour?
How far does it go in an hour?'

Lucy: 'Two hundred and'

Terence: 'Right.'

Lucy: 'thirty.'

Terence: 'So can it go twelve hundred and fifty kilometres in half an hour?'

Lucy: 'No.'

Terence: 'How far can it go in half an hour?'

Lucy: 'Erm one hundred and'

Terence: 'One thousand'

Lucy: 'one thousand an'

Terence: 'one hundred'

Lucy: 'yeah, yeah fifty'

Terence: 'and fifty, right, so the answer is no it can only do eleven hundred and fifty kilometres in half an hour.
Right, average speed'

Lucy: 'Ha oh [UNK] Terry'

Terence: 'Mhm?'

Lucy: 'Will you take me letterboxing one day this week if you can?'

Terence: 'I don't think it's gonna be possible this week but perhaps in the Easter holidays erm'

Lucy: 'Okay'

Terence: 'we'll be able to manage it.'

Lucy: 'Yeah.
Okay.
It is a hundred miles from King's lions'

Terence: 'King's Lynn.'

Lucy: 'King's Lynn where's that?'

Terence: 'Erm do you know where The Wash is?
No if you think of a map of England erm the south coast is there, there's Dover, there's the estuary for London, London is here erm then it comes up like this, the east coast of London, the east coast of E England like that this is East, called East Anglia, here you've got Norfolk and Norwich and then you've got Ipswich here and then you've got Suffolk there and Essex, right?
Can you remember that bulge in the map of England?
Well that piece up there is called The Wash'

Lucy: 'Oh.'

Terence: 'and King's Lynn is close to the wash, King's Lynn is in this area here.'

Lucy: 'Oh.'

Terence: 'So from London to King's Lynn is, they say, a hundred miles and I'll take their word for it, London to Ipswich in fact is seventy miles.'

Lucy: 'Oh.'

Terence: 'But, yeah, that's about a hundred miles you see, that would be about right, yeah.'

Lucy: 'Oh.'

Terence: 'So that's where it is.
North of London.
Up by The Wash.
Right it is a hundred miles from King's Lynn to London, the train takes two hours to do the journey the train does not go at a constant speed, it speeds up sometimes and slows down at other times it also stops at stations on the way and on once of course as it, as it's stopping it's going more and more slowly and as it's er moving off again it starts slowly and starts to go quickly but because it takes two hours in all the train goes a hundred miles in two hours we say its average speed for the journey is fifty miles per hour.
It says if it was travelling at a constant speed of fifty miles an hour.
It doesn't, sometimes it goes more slowly sometimes it goes more quickly, sometimes it stops but because it takes two hours to do the hundred miles we say its average speed for the journey is fifty miles per hour.
Its real speed changes during the journey sometimes it is more than fifty miles per hour, sometimes less but in two hours it goes the same distance as it would if its speed was fifty miles per hour all the time.'

Lucy: 'Oh.'

Terence: 'So we say its average speed is fifty miles per hour.
There used to be a train called the Cheltenham Flyer there it is it went from Cheltenham to London a hundred and twenty miles in two hours do you know where Cheltenham is?'

Terence: 'Well if there is the south coast along here and Devo C Cornwall is there and Devon is here and you get the w the Bristol Channel going up here and then you c the coast coming down here and there's Wales is here right?
Bristol is there, right?
And if you go up from Bristol on from here you go up the motorway to Bristol and then you go along the M four to London well north of Bristol, up where the River Severn gets quite narrow and can be bridged is a city called Gloucester and Cheltenham is just inland from Gloucester.'

Lucy: 'Oh.'

Terence: 'So Cheltenham is about there, and it's about a hundred and twenty miles from Cheltenham to London.'

Lucy: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'Right?'

Lucy: 'Okay.'

Terence: 'So there's Cheltenham.
Right so it went from Cheltenham to London, a hundred and twenty miles, in two hours, what was its average speed?'

Lucy: 'Mm'

Terence: 'Well if it, if it average speed is a hundred and twenty miles in two hours how far in fact would it go in one hour?'

Lucy: 'Sixty.'

Terence: 'So what was its average speed?'

Lucy: 'Sixty.'

Terence: 'Sixty miles per hour.'

Lucy: 'Oh'

Terence: 'It wasn't its actual speed there will be sometimes it will be going very slowly, sometimes it will be going much more quickly but its average speed was sixty miles an hour because at sixty miles an hour it would cover a hundred and twenty miles, which was the distance, in two hours.'

Lucy: 'Oh'

Terence: 'Right?'

Lucy: 'This book isn't very big is it?'

Terence: 'No, none of them are really are they?
Well this one's very small isn't it?'

Lucy: 'Yeah cos look [UNK]'

Terence: 'Oh well you're gonna get on aren't you?
Great, yeah, you're half way through.'

Lucy: 'Ha!
Only got s nine pages'

Terence: 'Mm.
Right so that was C one, C two it is a hundred and fifty miles from Hereford to London by rail Hereford is north of Cheltenham, it's going up from Cheltenham is Hereford the first train in the morning takes three hours for the journey what's its average speed?
Right'

Lucy: 'Can we go on the computer today?'

Terence: 'Well there might be time, we'll see how we get on.
Now it says B what did you do with th the numbers one hundred and fifty and three to get the answer?'

Lucy: 'Divided a hundred by three.'

Terence: 'Right so you write that down, you divided a hundred and fifty by three.'

Lucy: 'I wonder what my brother's doing now.'

Terence: 'Well at the present moment it's about, where he is it's about half past five, twenty to six, so he is probably waiting for his supper I should think his evening meal.
He won't be, he'll have finished skiing now.'

Lucy: 'Mm.
Does it get dark over there quick?'

Terence: 'It probably gets dark about the same time as it does here.'

Lucy: 'It's not dark quicker there now would it?'

Terence: 'No it would probably be, you know, no it will be about this, be a little bit darker than this.
It gets dark, it'll be dark there before it is dark here'

Lucy: 'Mm.
mm'

Terence: 'because it's further east so the sun is further away from them because the sun rises in the east so it gets light earlier that's why we put the clocks on when you go to Europe, one hour.'

Lucy: 'Oh.
In America it's loads isn't it?'

Terence: 'Well in America it's the other way, in America i i it is after us because they are further west than we are.'

Lucy: 'Yeah cos it's about six hours different.'

Terence: 'Mm, that's right.
Right C three'

Lucy: 'I've been to Penzance.
I know'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Lucy: 'where that is.
That's near mile end no what's it called Land's End.'

Terence: 'Land's End that's right, yes.'

Lucy: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'It's right down at the far south west.
It's it's more than a hundred miles from us.
It's about a hundred and thirty miles from us down to Penzance.
So you know we're about two hundred miles from London, so we're about, only about two thirds of the way from London to Penzance.'

Lucy: 'Have you been to L erm Land's End since they've'

Terence: 'Yes.'

Lucy: 'done it all up?'

Terence: 'Oh I don't know since they've done it all up, no probably not.'

Lucy: 'It's good there now.'

Terence: 'Is it?'

Lucy: 'Yeah they show you this'

Terence: 'Mm'

Lucy: 'erm you go in this place and erm and it shows you all the boats and things, and you can have a go on, there's this thing where they crawl up [UNK].
And then you go through this door and it's all old like things [UNK] and then you go and see erm and you go into this place and it's like telling you all the erm history and things like that'

Terence: 'Does it.'

Lucy: 'and it's got like rocks and things and erm statues doing like erm digging up gold and things a and it's got'

Terence: 'Oh yeah?'

Lucy: 'erm like a ship'

Terence: 'Mast?'

Lucy: 'Yeah that's it, all fell down and it went [UNK] like that [UNK]'

Terence: 'yeah [UNK].'

Lucy: 'And there's lots of other things there as well.'

Terence: 'Right, Penzance is three hundred and five miles from London by rail the train leaves Penzance at five eighteen A M'

Lucy: 'Ooh ooh'

Terence: 'and gets to London at ten eighteen AM.'

Lucy: 'How many hours does the journey take?
Five hours.'

Terence: 'Five hours.'

Lucy: 'Erm five into thirty goes ei si sixty five?'

Terence: 'No.'

Lucy: 'Oh.
What's five into three hundred and'

Terence: 'Fives into three hundred and five.
Fives into thirty goes six'

Lucy: 'Sixty one.'

Terence: 'Sixty one.
Good.
Right C four from Carlisle to London is three hundred miles gracious me, you see if you've got a map of England, we haven't [UNK] got it on here but if you imagine England going up here, Carlisle is right'

Terence: 'now just think about it if you go out of your front door'

Lucy: 'My front door'

Terence: 'and you turn left'

Lucy: 'turn left'

Terence: 'and you go to a junction don't you?'

Lucy: 'Yeah [UNK]'

Lucy: 'No.'

Terence: 'It is called Coach Road'

Lucy: 'Ooh!'

Terence: 'and it is the er it's called Coach Road because that is the road that the coaches used to go along to Totnes'

Lucy: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'and from Totnes to Plymouth.
And it is the old Coach Road.
So a hundred and fifty years ago you would have the stagecoach going past here.'

Lucy: 'Were these houses there then?'

Terence: 'No.'

Lucy: 'No?'

Terence: 'No.'

Lucy: 'What would of been here?'

Terence: 'That house might well have been here that big house just there across th in there which has now been turned into flats.'

Lucy: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'Er I don't know when that was built, it might not have been built but it er it's Victorian so it could have been built like in eighteen thirty soon fa certainly soon after eighteen thirty that would have been built.'

Lucy: 'When were our houses built?'

Terence: 'About nineteen sixty nineteen sixty six.'

Lucy: 'How old are our houses?'

Terence: 'Well if they were built in sixty six, and I think they were, they are now, how old are they now?'

Lucy: 'Sixty six did you say?'

Terence: 'I said I think they were built in nineteen sixty six.
So how old are they?'

Lucy: 'Nineteen th eighty something years.'

Terence: 'No!'

Lucy: 'Eighty four years old.'

Terence: 'No!
Nineteen sixty six, what are we now?'

Lucy: 'Nineteen ninety two.'

Terence: 'Right, well how many years is that?'

Lucy: 'I don't know.
Fifty seventy eighty ni three thirty years?'

Terence: 'Well ninety six it will be thirty years.'

Lucy: 'So twenty [UNK] twenty four years?'

Terence: 'About twenty six years.'

Lucy: 'Yeah!'

Terence: 'About twenty six years.'

Lucy: 'That's oh I thought they were very old.'

Terence: 'No.'

Lucy: 'Where have you lived in?
Would you a hou the house did you live into it when it was new?'

Terence: 'No.'

Lucy: 'No?'

Terence: 'No.
I don't know ho certainly I know there had been at least two peo different lots of people living in ours before we moved in, and I would think there were probably more than that.
Cos we moved in in about nineteen I think we moved in in nineteen eighty nineteen eighty, nineteen eighty one we moved in.'

Lucy: 'Oh [UNK]'

Terence: 'Mm?'

Lucy: 'in the house that she's lived in that she's in now all her life'

Terence: 'Who?'

Lucy: 'My nan.'

Terence: 'Your nan.'

Lucy: 'All her life since she was little.
She'

Terence: 'Gracious'

Lucy: 'she, she came g went to the house when she came back from hospital and she's still living in it now.'

Terence: 'Good lord.
Right come on me girl let's get on a little bit.
D, otherwise we're not gonna have time to go on the computer'

Lucy: 'Oh!'

Terence: 'D well yes we can because you can, you can finish it off at home can't you?
Yes, right.
So D calculating journey times'

Lucy: 'Oh oh look it's got the place.
You know there, Poole, is that'

Terence: 'Yeah'

Lucy: 'no it's not is it?'

Terence: 'I don't know.
Is it what?'

Lucy: 'No cos, can you go across there to France from there?'

Terence: 'I don't know erm Portsmouth more likely.'

Lucy: 'Yeah that's where I'm going to go'

Terence: 'Yes.
Mm'

Lucy: 'yeah Portsmouth.'

Terence: 'Oh Portsmouth is here.
It's not marked but it's there is Portsmouth.'

Lucy: 'I'm going to France from there.'

Terence: 'Are you?'

Lucy: 'How long does it take to get to there from our house?
Or from'

Terence: 'What Portsmouth?'

Lucy: 'from Newton Abbott?'

Terence: 'To, to, to Portsmouth?'

Lucy: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'Well, three hours, three to four hours.
And then it's eight hours on the boat.'

Lucy: 'I like boats even though I haven't even been on one.'

Terence: 'Oh do you?
Good.'

Lucy: 'Yes.
Do you like boats?'

Terence: 'Don't mind them.
You've never been on a big boat?
Have you not?'

Lucy: 'Haven't been on a boat I don't thi o only like little, you know, [UNK]'

Terence: 'Oh.
Oh that's gonna be quite an experience then isn't it?
You haven't been to France then?
Yes you have, you've flown of course.'

Lucy: 'No haven't been to France.'

Terence: 'Well you've been to Austria.'

Lucy: 'I've been to Austria, yeah.'

Terence: 'Yes but you've flown?
You haven't done a, been on a boat?
Mm.'

Lucy: 'Yeah, no not on a boat, no.'

Terence: 'Right.'

Lucy: 'It's nicer flying.'

Terence: 'A motor boat has a speed of four miles per hour this means it goes four miles in every hour'

Lucy: 'Oh.'

Terence: 'how many hours does it take to go from Lulworth to Bournemouth?'

Lucy: 'Twenty four hours?'

Terence: 'No.'

Lucy: 'Oh erm silly me'

Terence: 'It's twenty four miles.'

Lucy: 'Twenty four miles?
And how, it takes a minute a mile doesn't it?'

Terence: 'No.
What does it say it goes?'

Lucy: 'Twenty four miles.'

Terence: 'Yeah but what is the speed of the boat?'

Lucy: 'Oh!
Four miles per hour.'

Terence: 'Right.'

Lucy: 'Six.'

Terence: 'Right, six hours.'

Lucy: 'Six hours.'

Terence: 'How long does it take, how many hours does it take to go from Swanage to Ventnor?'

Lucy: 'Ventnor.
Where am I?
Swanage'

Terence: 'Well it tells you how far it is, look'

Lucy: 'Yeah'

Terence: 'so you can, there's Swanage and there's Ventnor'

Lucy: 'That's in the Isle of Wight.'

Terence: 'That's on the Isle of Wight.'

Lucy: 'I haven't been there.
Have you been there?'

Terence: 'Yes.'

Lucy: 'Have you been that part there?'

Terence: 'No'

Lucy: 'Have you been to that part there?'

Terence: 'No I don't think we landed at Cowes I think we landed over here further.'

Lucy: 'Did you fly?'

Terence: 'No, went on a hovercraft well wen went on the hovercraft and came back on a, a ferry on the boat.'

Lucy: 'What's a hovercraft?'

Terence: 'Well it's a very specialized boat in a sense, I mean it goes on the surface of the water and it literally goes on the surface of the water, it's a hovercraft is a sort of a it's a vessel which has got a skirt all round it'

Lucy: 'Is it a rubber one?'

Terence: 'Yes, heavy thick rubber skirt and that the engines do two things, they, they drive propellers in the air and they pump air from under the vessel onto the surface of the water and the skirt round the boat'

Lucy: 'Keeps dry'

Terence: 'keeps a cushion of air under the vessel so that really it hovers on top of the water and the air propellers drive it like an aeroplane'

Lucy: 'Oh'

Terence: 'but it skims across the surface of the water and it's very quick, it only takes half an hour to go from Ramsgate to Dover.'

Lucy: 'Mm!'

Terence: 'Right er from Swanage to Ventnor is thirty two miles so how long would a motor boat take?'

Lucy: 'Eight hours.'

Terence: 'Eight hours, right.'

Lucy: 'Colin's dad's got a boat.'

Terence: 'Has he?
And how long would it take to go round the Isle of Wight, which is sixty miles round the Isle of Wight?'

Lucy: 'Er erm fifteen?'

Terence: 'Fifteen hours, right.
Right D two how long does it take to go from Ventnor to Swanage in a launch with a speed of eight miles per hour?'

Lucy: 'Oh Ventnor, where's Ventnor?
Ah twenty two miles four'

Terence: 'Right.'

Lucy: 'four hours.'

Terence: 'Right, now you get the answer to D two by dividing the distance by the speed'

Lucy: 'Mm?'

Terence: 'thirty two's the distance divided by the speed which is eight, thirty two divided by eight is four this is the rule for working out a journey time distance in miles divided by speed in miles per hour gives you the time in hours.
Right.
You need a calculator.'

Lucy: 'I need a calculator.
Ooh'

Terence: 'How many hours does it take to go seven hundred and five miles at forty seven miles per hour?'

Lucy: 'Fifteen hours.'

Terence: 'Right.'

Lucy: 'This is fun I like talking into This diagram shows the reach or an airline distances are in kilometres the figures for them are only rough one, a jet flies from Beirut'

Terence: 'Beirut to'

Lucy: 'to Bombay at four thousand kilometres.
Its speed is about eight hundred kilometres per hour'

Terence: 'Eight hundred and'

Lucy: 'fifty'

Terence: 'fifty'

Lucy: 'kilometres per hour to work out the time it takes we do four thousand divided by three er eight hundred and fifty.
The answer on the calculator is four point seven O five double eight two three hours but we do not need that [UNK] as that'

Terence: 'To be as exact as that'

Lucy: 'because the distance is'

Terence: 'because the d not exactly four thousand miles and the speed is not exactly eight hundred and fifty kilometres per hour.'

Lucy: 'The nearest whole number of hours is good enough.
The nearest whole number of hours [UNK] Do you take it by that number?'

Terence: 'The nearest whole number to four point seven the wh nearest whole number to four point seven nought five double eight two three is five because to the nearest whole number you look at that four, it's either gonna be four or five depending upon what that number is'

Lucy: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'isn't it?
If that's five or more then you pu increase that by one and make it five.
So the journey time is about five hours.
So D four work out these journey times to the nearest hour.
Bombay to Perth at about eight hundred and fifty kilometres an hour'

Lucy: 'Bombay to Perth eight'

Terence: 'Hours.'

Lucy: 'Mm?'

Terence: 'Eight hours, right.'

Lucy: 'Rome to Beirut two hundred and [UNK]'

Terence: 'Pardon?'

Lucy: 'Two thousand two hundred'

Terence: 'Two thousand two hundred, right.'

Lucy: 'Four hours.'

Terence: 'Right.'

Lucy: 'London to [UNK]'

Terence: 'London to Geneva'

Lucy: 'Oh.'

Terence: 'Geneva.'

Lucy: 'Geneva.
[UNK] hundred and fifty.
One hour.'

Terence: 'Right.'

Lucy: 'It only takes half an hour to go to Austria doesn't it?
No, it takes an hour'

Terence: 'No it takes an hour and a half.'

Lucy: 'Mm, yeah, [UNK] It takes four hours to get to Lanzarote.
Six hours.'

Terence: 'Good.
Right'

Lucy: 'E'

Terence: 'Now this is quite important, you've got to think about this calculate as work in decimals.
But we usually think of time as hours and minutes and seconds too if we are being very exact.
This scale shows both minutes and decimals as an hour.
Thirty minutes half an hour, nought point five'

Lucy: 'Mm'

Terence: 'right?
Erm fifteen minutes nought point two five.
Forty five minutes three quarters of an hour, nought point seven five and all the different calculations in between fifty minutes is about nought point that's nought eight, that's nought nine so it'd be nought point eight one, two'

Lucy: 'Four'

Terence: 'three isn't it?
Just over three.'

Lucy: 'Mm yeah.'

Terence: 'Right?
So it says this scale shows both minutes and decimals and now use the scale to change these to minutes.
Now what's point three of an hour in minutes?'

Lucy: 'Ten point'

Terence: 'No nought point three's there look'

Lucy: 'Mm'

Terence: 'now you want to read off the top of the scale for minutes.'

Lucy: 'Fifteen minutes'

Terence: 'That's ten minutes'

Lucy: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'that's twenty minutes that's fifteen minutes'

Lucy: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'what's each of those little divisions?'

Lucy: 'One minute.'

Terence: 'Right so point three'

Lucy: 'Fifteen minut er fif eighteen minutes.'

Terence: 'Eighteen minutes, right.
B nought point seven five of an hour?'

Lucy: 'There forty five minutes.'

Terence: 'Forty five minutes.
C nought point four three hours nought point four three'

Lucy: 'Oh!'

Terence: 'four'

Lucy: 'Nought point [UNK]'

Terence: 'four three'

Lucy: 'There'

Terence: 'That's right, well what's that?'

Lucy: 'Twenty and six minutes'

Terence: 'Si twenty six minutes.
And nought point nought five of an hour?'

Lucy: 'There'

Terence: 'Mhm in minutes.'

Lucy: 'Three.'

Terence: 'Three minutes.
Then E, change these to decimals of an hour twenty four minutes'

Lucy: 'Nought point four.'

Terence: 'Nought point four.
Fifty one minutes?'

Lucy: 'Nought point eight five.'

Terence: 'Nought point five, good.
Five minutes'

Lucy: 'Nought point nought point nought eight.'

Terence: 'Right.
And thirty five minutes.'

Lucy: 'Nought point five eight.'

Terence: 'Right.
Right well we'll just do this then you can have a go on the computer.
The distance from London to Weymouth is a hundred and forty three miles the train takes two hours forty two minutes for the journey'

Lucy: 'Mm?'

Terence: 'we can find the train's average speed like this change forty two minutes to a decimal of an hour what's that?'

Lucy: 'Nought point seven.'

Terence: 'Right.
From the scale above forty two minutes equals nought point seven hours'

Lucy: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'that means the journey time is two point seven hours, two hours forty two minutes is two point seven hours'

Lucy: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'divide the distance by the time hundred and forty three divided by two point seven equals fifty two point nine round off to the nearest whole number that would be?'

Lucy: 'Fifty three.'

Terence: 'So the average speed is about fifty three miles per hour.'

Lucy: 'Oh.'

Terence: 'So do the first one here'

Lucy: 'Okay'

Terence: 'D two, London to Bristol, a hundred and eighteen miles at one hour twenty seven minutes.'

Lucy: 'Nought point f n nought point four five.
So one hour p one hour point, point forty five?'

Terence: 'One point four five'

Lucy: 'Yeah.
Nought point [UNK] one nought.'

Terence: 'So that's the average speed?'

Lucy: 'Yeah er'

Terence: 'What did you do wrong?'

Lucy: 'Divided it.'

Terence: 'Yes, but what did you divide by what?'

Lucy: 'Divided a hundred and eighteen by'

Terence: 'No you didn't'

Lucy: 'Oh.'

Terence: 'you divided one point'

Lucy: 'Oh no'

Terence: 'four five by a hundred and eighteen.'

Lucy: 'Oh.'

Terence: 'So what have you got to do?'

Lucy: 'Hundred and eighteen'

Terence: 'Right, divided by'

Lucy: 'by, I've forgotten what it was now.'

Terence: 'One point four five.'

Lucy: 'Aha!'

Terence: 'What's that?'

Lucy: 'Eighty one.'

Terence: 'Right miles per hour.'

Lucy: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'Now just for interest's sake do what you did before, divide'

Lucy: 'Okay'

Terence: 'one point four five by one one eight, equals now'

Terence: 'that's the wrong way, you've done it the wrong way haven't you?'

Lucy: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'So push that button'

Lucy: 'Oh!
Oh!!
It's turned it the other way round.'

Terence: 'It's the reciprocal button'

Lucy: 'Oh'

Terence: 'and a half, one over two the reciprocal of a half if you turn it the other way round it's two over one'

Lucy: 'Yes.'

Terence: 'so it's two.'

Lucy: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'A half is point five'

Lucy: 'Mm?'

Terence: 'the reciprocal is gonna be two.'

Lucy: 'Ooh.'

Terence: 'Right?
A quarter'

Terence: 'Oh haven't we?'

Margaret: 'That one we had first so'

Terence: 'Oh finish that yeah, yeah'

Margaret: 'just find it in the fridge'

Margaret: 'or something, but I cooked'

Terence: 'Have you got potatoes?'

Margaret: 'Where did I put that?
You put it there and I put it somewhere else'

Terence: 'What's that?
The mat?'

Margaret: 'I thought I put it over there, erm I would only want half of these potatoes, would you manage those?'

Terence: 'Ha, I don't know I'll have one anyway, I'll see then when I, whether I can manage the other half afterwards or not, cos it looks enormous'

Margaret: 'Well they're all big now aren't they?'

Terence: 'They are, that's right'

Margaret: 'There was one that I had to throw away because it was erm'

Terence: 'Oh is that so'

Margaret: 'all damaged at one end and I, you know, erm thought I'd cut that away'

Terence: 'Yeah'

Margaret: 'but in fact it was bad all the way through'

Terence: 'Mm'

Margaret: 'so, I must confess when I say that we've had bad, like that time when Did you give er Lucy back her English?'

Terence: 'Mm, mm'

Margaret: 'I thought she was clutching it as she went past here but erm, oh you've had some?'

Terence: 'No I haven't, I haven't, when you've had yours'

Margaret: 'This is the cheesy one I bought some beetroot the other day, they had some nice little ones, which I must cook, they were ever so cheap, I've forgotten how cheap but you know they were really cheap'

Terence: 'Mm'

Margaret: 'Now can you see what I did with the lid at them?'

Terence: 'Yes'

Margaret: 'Oh perhaps I never had it a man came here, from somebody or other double glazing'

Terence: 'Oh I heard the bell go'

Margaret: 'I thought it might of been Pat sort of at that time, but erm when I looked out I saw a man with a billboard thing'

Terence: 'One of the little maps in the book shows the Isle of Wight with some towns round the Isle of Wight, and it said Poole so she said Poole, she said the boat sailed from out of France?
So I said no Portsmouth oh she said that's right she said I'm going from Portsmouth'

Margaret: 'Oh is she?'

Terence: 'Oh I said, yes she said, I like going on a boat, she said not that I've been on one she said she's never been on a boat across'

Margaret: 'No I don't think any of them have you see'

Terence: 'Oh, she's you know, when she's been to Austria of course she's flown'

Margaret: 'Yes that's right'

Terence: 'so she's erm, quite looking forward to that'

Margaret: 'She is, gave her some of the warnings that er'

Terence: 'No I didn't actually, but'

Margaret: 'I shouldn't think it great easy to fall off a boat actually would you?'

Terence: 'No well having said that, if you're fool enough to sit on the side'

Margaret: 'Oh yeah but I mean if you're sitting on a seat or if you've got sort of have the rails'

Terence: 'Ah, mm, mm, mm'

Margaret: 'looking at the water, I think you would have to sort of climb up over the rails to fall in wouldn't you?'

Terence: 'Oh yeah, you'd have to perch up on them, sit on them, you know'

Margaret: 'Mm'

Terence: 'well I mean you know, you know what children are, you never know what they might do'

Margaret: 'I always took the point about the children in the hall didn't they?'

Terence: 'Mm, mm'

Margaret: 'They hadn't thought about that do you know, I reckon that Sister Josephine erm behind all this, she wanted that hall and she and Father [UNK] used to talk about this you see they want to extend the church back and do away with the car parking area as well, oh that's alright, but erm sort of can't see any point in it, I mean congregations are going down, they're not increasing, the church is big enough for what is necessary I would of thought wouldn't you?
Don't need a cathedral in it'

Terence: 'Well of course you never know I mean if they close Saint Gregory's'

Margaret: 'I wouldn't of thought they'd do that'

Terence: 'Mm, I wouldn't, but'

Margaret: 'They'd of more like I would of thought close King Staiton because Saint Gregory's was a purpose built church'

Terence: 'Yeah'

Margaret: 'but I never forget the way that Doreen when she said we were doing things, she said you shouldn't of started it she said, you'll only get kicked in the teeth at Saint Joseph's'

Terence: 'Is that what she said?'

Margaret: 'Oh yes right from the beginning'

Terence: 'Did she really?
I didn't know that oh'

Margaret: 'Yes, when we came out here I'll never forget Mark, not even saying thank you, not, not even for raising the money I mean I wouldn't expect that from the parishioners, that's what we should be trying to do, but even for the food and that, till erm Kitty and and the way he got up then and said it, most ungraciously'

Terence: 'Yes mind you I had to admit, you know me, I know, never have been very impressed with him'

Margaret: 'With him, well for some reason he doesn't like us, well, you say I was thinking, I've been thinking as you know this is the sort of thing that I, gets on to my mind, but I was thinking to myself well really and truly we are so honest people ourselves, we don't go round you know and screw sort of fiddling things, I suppose it comes to hard to us when we discover other people have'

Terence: 'Yeah'

Margaret: 'but I know Kay wasn't very pleased with Sister about these sort of erm stout things, cos Sister said well if they're not collected by the time of the next jumble, we sort of empty the cupboard and put them all in for erm the jumble sale Kay said to me they're not hers to do that with'

Terence: 'Mind you'

Margaret: 'No, no, no that was, I mean Kay did what she had to do and sort of got the person'

Terence: 'Yeah, fair enough'

Margaret: 'to do it, but Sister wouldn't of even have that, she would of just erm, chucked them, but I know Kay put a lot of work into, she's not coming'

Terence: 'Who's not coming?'

Margaret: 'Whoever is due to come'

Terence: 'Good evening, hello Richard, mm, mm they have turned it down, oh good'

Margaret: 'I was thinking of him'

Margaret: 'today, at this erm'

Terence: 'Planning'

Margaret: 'planning, what did he say?'

Terence: 'He, it was unanimous'

Margaret: 'Turned down'

Terence: 'Turned down he said now of course we have to wait and see whether they go to appeal, as, as of course he said they're entitled to do, but er'

Margaret: 'She'd say they've just had a restaurant there, that wouldn't be so bad as a take away But getting back to the finances, I mean the Two Hundred Club over the years it has been in operation, I mean with what it gets this, what they get this year, supposing it's not a thousand, supposing eight hundred, it might even be about eight thousand mightn't it?'

Terence: 'It might be eight thousand, yeah'

Margaret: 'Mm and I was just wondering if that is your girl who is due to come at a quarter past six then she erm'

Terence: 'Oh yeah'

Terence: 'I understand the'

Terence: 'go upstairs and get erm'

## 039404

Terence: 'You see, you there?'

Margaret: 'Yeah jointly insured for major contingencies and potential legal liabilities, the recent re review however has highlighted that we can only insure our own legal liabilities and that we cannot insure or assume responsibility for your prudential legal liabilities'

Margaret: 'This is to the rent is?'

Terence: 'Yeah hall hired from you for a function'

Terence: 'injury due to affect the hall itself, E G the floor tile, it is likely that the responsibility for the floor tiling ensuing claim would fall upon us to be dealt with, however you're insured to'

Terence: 'lack of supervision'

Terence: 'public liability insurance but you see we can'

Margaret: 'We insure'

Terence: 'only insure our own league and so it, I mean insured for major contingencies and that'

Margaret: 'I mean you showed that to Father when it was all, cos wasn't there something'

Terence: 'No I haven't showed this to er, I haven't showed this to'

Margaret: 'No not to Father'

Terence: 'No'

Terence: 'Yeah'

Terence: 'I mean it is, it is ridiculous because we've had that November party down there, and if it does need a bit of planning, you just put the heat on a bit early anyway'

Margaret: 'Well'

Terence: 'I can't be bothered any more'

Margaret: 'No, I think you just wash your hands, that's it, cos we've done long enough and I mean from say the Sunday thing, I mean we've never ever thought of the Sunday making thing, being a profit making thing have we?'

Terence: 'No'

Margaret: 'That was always right from the beginning'

Margaret: 'it was always sort of for social thing and pe people couldn't pay well that was alright, they didn't pay as you say, we've done our whack really'

Terence: 'Too true we have'

Margaret: 'By the way is there anything we need to record, something'

Terence: 'No is, I mean I have to be out by half past seven, actually, something on half past seven on, you know, on the other programme that'll be worth recording I think, something about'

Margaret: 'There is a'

Terence: 'ski safety in America'

Margaret: 'Yeah that's right, mm, that's erm what's his name, isn't it?
John Stapleton'

Terence: 'spoiled.
The trouble is I mean if, if it did, it came up and he wanted to sell it would of it would obviously decrease the value.'

Margaret: 'Yeah, that was what he was thinking of.'

Terence: 'You'd get all the rubbish from a take-away as well blowing into his garden, I mean it wouldn't have been very pleasant.'

Margaret: '[UNK] much he reckons his house is worth now.
But I suppose in a way they would have then been contemplating selling their own house and getting somewhere else before in fact'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'It's a shame because I mean it I think what they've got is really you know, er er er they'd be hard put to it to get anything as good really at the price I think.
Mind you they'd probably get a hundred thousand for theirs I should think now.'

Margaret: 'Yes I think, that's what I was thinking of.'

Terence: 'Do you remember when we used to come out here for the primroses?
That's a long time ago isn't it?'

Margaret: 'No it wasn't, it was in here in the grounds of erm Dartington.'

Terence: 'Good morning!
Oh!'

[UNK]: 'Alright?
Thank you very much indeed!'

[UNK]: 'Thanks.
Bye!'

[UNK]: 'Thank you.
Bye bye then!'

Terence: 'Thank you!'

[UNK]: 'Hello.'

Terence: 'Have you any erm stamps?'

[UNK]: 'First class or second class sir?'

Terence: 'Second class.'

[UNK]: 'Yes.'

Terence: 'Five please.'

[UNK]: 'Right.
Certainly!
I'll get those for you.
Give that gentleman his paper.
There you are.'

Terence: 'That's right.'

[UNK]: 'Lovely!
Thank you very much!'

[UNK]: 'Thanks Mr [UNK].
Five seconds my love.'

Terence: 'That'll do.'

[UNK]: 'Let's see what we've got, ooh I dunno if I've got, ooh yes I have!
Yes I have!
That'll be ninety pence won't it?
Five tens are'

Terence: 'That's right!'

[UNK]: 'fifty, five eights are forty, ninety pence.
Good job I learnt my tables when I was at school!'

Terence: 'There's a lot that don't do it these days!'

[UNK]: 'Well my son does.
They're very hard [UNK] at his school, we've always done them!
It's very important!'

Terence: 'It's ever so important!'

[UNK]: 'But, from an early age because without'

Terence: 'That's right.'

[UNK]: 'tables you can't do multiplication, [UNK]'

Terence: 'It takes so, it takes so long to do everything you see.'

[UNK]: 'You can't do anything!'

Terence: 'That's right.'

[UNK]: 'You know, and I mean where he used to go to school they didn't teach them them till they were ten!
What the hell of a use is that!'

Terence: 'No good at all!'

[UNK]: 'So I mean he is very, very good at his tables and we bought one of those Early Learning tapes when he was quite young that you sing'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'to.'

Terence: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'And I always learnt mine parrot fashion using'

Terence: 'That's right.'

[UNK]: 'sticks.'

Terence: 'That's right.'

[UNK]: 'And then we got a table tester to help them refresh their memories, it's like a disc and then you got the slots and then it tells you your eight times and that's good as well but I mean he's got them off by heart which is brilliant!'

Terence: 'Well it it saves so much time as well you see because and you get on so much quicker with everything!'

[UNK]: 'Well absolutely!
And I mean, fortunately he is very good at his maths and he's quick at his sums and things because he knows his tables.
There's erm'

Terence: 'That's right.'

[UNK]: 'so much difference!'

Terence: 'Well I've got, I pu put a program on, I've got a computer and I'

[UNK]: 'Oh yes!'

Terence: 'put a program on the computer for maths'

[UNK]: 'Oh right!'

Terence: 'and it's er it's erm it's a table program amongst others, adding'

[UNK]: 'Oh that's good!'

Terence: 'and subtraction and multiplication.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'But, you know they can pick it and er, it just flashes up and they have to put the right answer in, if they get the right answer it it goes on to the next one, if it'

[UNK]: 'Oh that's good!'

Terence: 'get the wrong answer'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'then i it says no that's wrong!
Sorry la whatever he name is that [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'What age group is that for then?'

Terence: 'Well this is really for anybody learning the tables.
But, primarily it's it's it's, you know top end of the primary school.'

[UNK]: 'Oh it sounds good!'

Terence: 'But you co could go on, I mean if you if they don't know it you can still use it when they get to secondary school.'

[UNK]: 'What computer is that then?'

Terence: 'Oh it's er, it's erm'

[UNK]: 'B B C [UNK] or'

Terence: 'It's a Tandy actually, it's one I had'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'given me about eight'

[UNK]: 'Right.'

Terence: 'years ago.
So, and it's an old one actually'

[UNK]: 'Oh!'

Terence: 'but I've put, put my own program so that the'

[UNK]: 'Ah!
That's a good idea!'

Terence: 'But how old is your'

[UNK]: 'He's nearly ten.
Yeah.
Nearly ten.
But he has, we we've only got, my husband's got a computer at work, we just got one of the Segas, the master systems you know that you you got th the games that you put in those but he wants to get another one next year but that's a good idea something like that!
Should be very good for schools I would think, wouldn't it?'

Terence: 'Well, yes of course, I mean I, the schools have got programs I mean you can, you know they er'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

Terence: 'Da ta [UNK] for it.'

[UNK]: 'Yes.
But that's, I think that's a brilliant idea actually!
Because where he goes is a smaller school where they go and erm I think something like that is nice for them to actually [UNK]'

Terence: 'Where does he go?'

[UNK]: 'He goes to a school in the Tene Valley, it's a teacher that, he used to go to Exeter school and the teacher's opened her own school and, only for lo a small time and then she's opening up actually in Exeter but this is an in between and she's a very good teacher!'

Terence: 'That's great, you see!'

[UNK]: 'And you see she's bringing him on very well!'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'I mean there's only a few kids there, they're all good mates and it's like private tuition.
But, I'

Terence: 'That's right.'

[UNK]: 'mean you pay for it, course you do but then'

Terence: 'That's right.'

[UNK]: 'on the ar, we well you know we've paid for his education since he was seven because he wasn't doing anything at primary school!
Half the teachers le left them doing nothing!'

Terence: 'It's a shame really!'

[UNK]: 'Yeah!
Yeah!
But er you know, and it would have been such a waste cos he's bright.
But that he was always naughty!
They used to write back and they said he was always being sent out and I said that's because he's bored!
He couldn't be bothered you see.
And how many more children slip through the net that way?'

Terence: 'That's right.'

[UNK]: 'It's very true.
An and so we we said right, that's it!
We'll have to get him out and pay for it and it's worked total dividends!
I mean he's very good at maths.
They say maths and science are his strength subjects well I'd never have known that if he was still over there!
I was just told he was a a fair average.
You know?'

[UNK]: 'Erm can I have sixteen of those [UNK] there?'

[UNK]: 'How many darling?'

[UNK]: 'Sixteen.'

[UNK]: 'They're two each, you know that do you?'

[UNK]: 'Oh!
I'll have'

[UNK]: 'Yeah they're two each my love.'

[UNK]: 'Er, then I'll'

[UNK]: 'You can have ten can't you?
If you've got twenty.'

[UNK]: 'Erm Yeah I'll have ten of them then.'

[UNK]: 'Cos you got twenty for your crisps then haven't you?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.

Terence: 'That's my allowance.'

[UNK]: 'Mm?'

Terence: 'That's my allowance!'

[UNK]: 'Oh!'

Terence: 'No I wa I'm I've I'

[UNK]: 'You haven't got a number or something I could always go in and ask his teacher she's never interested in if you've got a a tape or anything.
I mean if you do know sort of'

Terence: 'Yeah!
Erm I mean this is only a er this is only a sort of a a wa a program I've built myself'

[UNK]: 'Oh!'

Terence: 'but I mean, you know, yeah I mean it's erm'

[UNK]: 'If you have just, you know, drop it in'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'in cos it's always handy to give to her because she's she's looking for you know, I mean, sort of you know different things all the time and she's got various'

[UNK]: 'One of those?
Twelve ninety five?'

[UNK]: 'teachers that that come and help and erm'

[UNK]: 'No not one of them cos they're frozen!'

[UNK]: 'they've got one of the teachers from the old school who's very good at maths and erm geography'

[UNK]: 'You can have these Jelly Tots.'

[UNK]: 'and erm games.
And erm, she's very good!
She's a good all-rounder and she's good!'

[UNK]: 'Or you could have a Milky Bar?
Or a fudge?'

[UNK]: 'But I mean I'm so pleased with it!'

[UNK]: 'Could have some fruit gums?'

[UNK]: 'I mean, I've noticed that just'

Terence: 'Yeah, it's great isn't it?'

[UNK]: 'Well'

Terence: 'I it's i, I'm'

Terence: 'terribly sad that it happens, but it shouldn't happen, you see!'

[UNK]: 'And the thing is I found, also, it was [UNK]'

Terence: 'Ge da bo to to'

[UNK]: 'what what I found'

Terence: 'serve this dear lady!'

[UNK]: 'What is the [UNK], tomorrow will do!
It's the wrong, it's wrong you see it makes no discipline and the staff'

[UNK]: 'Er er'

[UNK]: 'just bringing you work then!'

[UNK]: 'They should of had [UNK].
Now that's sixty one isn't it?'

[UNK]: 'to the management!'

[UNK]: 'Fifty, sixty one!'

[UNK]: 'Thank you dear.'

[UNK]: 'Oh well it's nearly pay day we'll see isn't it?'

[UNK]: 'Thank you love.'

[UNK]: 'oh I shan't'

## 039608

Terence: 'Somebody didn't even know how many months there were in the year!'

[UNK]: 'I know!
I can imagine!'

Terence: 'You know?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'And days in the year is, is a'

[UNK]: 'I know!'

Terence: 'is a closed book!'

[UNK]: 'I used to help them there and one of the teachers oh my God!
I used to help with sticking the the er money onto the well this used to take about, you know, an hour all these kids didn't know what two pence was, didn't know what twenty pence was and ten pence and fifty pence and then we, they were in go about groups of seven and we get all this done then it would be assembly, then it'll be games and then that'll be it for the whole morning!
And I said what have they learnt?'

Terence: 'Nothing!'

[UNK]: 'What have they done?
And then she would listen to them read, well this is what they finished with they'd have a book and they'd take it up and she'd listen to one line!
How can you tell how er fluent a child is with it, with their reading'

Terence: 'That's right!'

[UNK]: 'and their, and their word knowledge by one line on a book?
There is no way!
And it was just reading [UNK], listen to, go and pick what books they wanted to.'

Terence: 'If they wanted to!'

[UNK]: 'If they wanted to!'

Terence: 'Yeah!
Yeah!
That's right!'

[UNK]: 'And i and my lad would bring home all these damn great big books that he couldn't read!
So I used to buy erm I used buy a lot of er the Meg and Mogs cos I found that they sort of helped him.
I mean, I was brought up on Janet and John, you know [UNK]'

Terence: 'Well it's great!'

[UNK]: 'But it was a number, you wrote down the one you wanted to [UNK]'

Terence: 'Yep!
And'

[UNK]: 'the'

Terence: 'it's progression!'

[UNK]: 'by your word knowledge!'

Terence: 'That's right!'

[UNK]: 'And erm wha what happened was we had Martin er assessed by an independent tutor, a guy that teaches [UNK] and he erm gave him some tutoring with maths, like probably'

## 039609

[UNK]: 'Yes and he said he's very bright!
He said but unfortunately because he's boisterous, which he is and because it's easier for them with their numbers to let him just get away with it or say oh Martin go outside we can't, you know, then then he wasn't learning to'

Terence: 'That's right!'

[UNK]: 'his full capacity.
So where he is now, they really stretch them but they unwind them in the afternoons by games and and'

Terence: 'That's it.'

[UNK]: 'and, you know'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'dra, and drama'

Terence: 'That's right!'

Terence: 'and er as it should be done.
And he's getting on very well.
Because he went to Little Abbotsbury Prep School and at the age of four I mean, he could read and read quite well actually, and erm write very well actually!
And do lots of things that I knew he was capable of doing.
And I learnt from various teachers that when you go to these private schools and they've been to [UNK] schools, they hold them back because they like, they don't like the'

Terence: 'They don't like somebody'

[UNK]: 'No.
They'

Terence: 'That's right!'

[UNK]: 'they, they like [UNK]'

Terence: 'it it it upsets the system!
Yep!'

[UNK]: 'But like there [UNK] and be all the same and that really upset me!
And I thought my God you know we've got him really on this far'

Terence: 'That's right!
And then it gets held back!'

[UNK]: 'and then he played in the afternoons!
And I i, you know at six and I said my God he did that at Abbotsbury when he was four!'

Terence: 'That's right!'

[UNK]: 'And so, i I mean it was to me it was a total waste of time over there!
I'll be honest with you.'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'And I live so near'

Terence: 'I know!'

[UNK]: 'that damn school it really, I thought'

Terence: 'It's a shame because years ago when Miss what was her'

[UNK]: 'Miss [UNK].'

Terence: 'Miss [UNK] and they had a lovely violin group there and'

[UNK]: 'But it's down to head though isn't it?'

Terence: 'I mean'

[UNK]: 'You know?'

Terence: 'and you know, and it was tremendous!'

## 039610

[UNK]: 'Thank you love.'

Terence: 'But i it's a shame because you see it's, it's really down to the a lot of the advisory staff and erm yo your teacher training colleges because there was a period when, I mean, I was always very formal I mean I, I, you know'

[UNK]: 'I think it's the right [UNK]'

Terence: 'you've got to work and and th'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'we had exams and you know?'

[UNK]: 'That's right!'

Terence: 'Er, it was er re'

[UNK]: 'And the three R's!
Which are so important!'

Terence: 'Course they are!
Vitally important!
But, towards the end, before I retired erm a lot of the staff didn't like what I was doing because I was still, you know, ant and the advisor would come in and say you know, you should do it, yo yo you know, it's too strict!'

[UNK]: 'There was that chap that was sacked up the country wasn't he?'

Terence: 'That's right!'

[UNK]: 'He was there being pushed out'

Terence: 'Same sort of thing you see!'

[UNK]: 'because you see they didn't'

Terence: 'But things are beginning'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, that's right!'

Terence: 'to go back you see.'

[UNK]: 'But you see it won't help my lad!
Or doesn't help [UNK].'

Terence: 'No, that's right!
That's right!'

[UNK]: 'It may, I mean i in the next decade it may help those but it, you see'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'that's why we had to get him out because it wasn't gonna help him!'

Terence: 'That's it!'

[UNK]: 'And this new curriculum at seven'

Terence: 'That's right!'

[UNK]: 'was gonna do nothing for'

Terence: 'No.'

[UNK]: 'him!'

Terence: 'My er'

Terence: 'my son, one of my so'

## 039611

Terence: 'Yes, erm on the other hand there are some'

Terence: 'there are some very good comprehensive schools!'

[UNK]: 'Oh yes!'

Terence: 'I mean you can't, you can't erm'

[UNK]: 'Thank you.'

[UNK]: 'Thank you love.'

Terence: 'There's some very bad grammar schools!'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, I agree with you.'

Terence: 'You know, again as you said earlier on it all comes down in the end to the head!'

[UNK]: 'You see we've had some very good reports [UNK], I mean that went through a very bad patch but they've this new Doctor Colin [UNK] he's meant to be pretty switched on'

Terence: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'and erm they say, you know it's it's turning into a very good school!
So that's one possibility to look at.
But I mean a a grammar doesn't suit every child does it?
Some kids erm er [UNK], you know.'

Terence: 'No it doesn't, you see.
I mean I yo, I would always say, you know if a child was borderline'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'If there was a doubt then he would be better not going to a grammar school'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Terence: 'because he would be at the top end of the other school'

[UNK]: 'That's right!
That is exactly that!'

Terence: 'and then success breeds success!'

[UNK]: 'That's right!
That's right.'

Terence: 'Erm whereas'

[UNK]: 'Right.'

Terence: 'er the same child goes to the grammar school, he's in the C stream, he's at bottom'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'at the end and they perhaps don't bother quite so much and'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'he, he drops back, he gets'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'further and further and further behind.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.
Now I found that, you see, cos I passed my eleven plus and I lived in Hampshire and the grammar school was Hampshire Grammar School for Girls, which was quite a long way away from where I lived and it would have entailed a bus and the train and I and there was only me that passed and I, I didn't wanna do it.
So I went to a very good secondary school but I was in the A one stream right the way through and I was always within that top three of that A one stream and it gave me confidence and I really got on.
And I never regretted not going.'

Terence: 'No.
That's right.'

[UNK]: 'You know a lot of people said to me oh how stupid!
To my mum, you know she's passed, you're daft, but there'd have been so much hassle for me to get there!'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'And I didn't feel confident, and I wasn't happy within'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'myself and my mum said if you're not, then you don't'

Terence: 'That's right!'

[UNK]: 'wanna go.'

Terence: 'That's right!'

[UNK]: 'And that's how I felt about'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'it, I didn't and I felt I'd have no friends around where I lived and you know, I'd always be alienated, I'd always be home later and I said to my mum I don't think I can cope with it, so she said right then you don't go!
And I didn't.
And I never regretted it, I'll be quite honest with you.
And I think lots of children probably feel that way.'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'And'

Terence: 'That's right!'

[UNK]: 'you know.
But it's'

Terence: 'Ha!'

[UNK]: 'nice talking to someone about education cos I talk to some people and they think I'm crackers cos I took my kid out of a state school!
You know?'

Terence: 'Ya, I I, I'm only sorry that you felt you'

[UNK]: 'Yeah that'

Terence: 'had to!
And I'm sorry'

[UNK]: 'I am!'

Terence: 'the fact that you had to!'

[UNK]: 'I am!'

Terence: 'Erm but I, you know I think that's that, that's an indictment of it you see because I'

[UNK]: 'Oh it's cost us an arm and a leg!
It really has!'

Terence: 'Yeah sure!'

[UNK]: 'An and it's what makes me so cross as I walk past that blinking school every day and you think my kid should be over there!'

Terence: 'That's it!'

[UNK]: 'That's just the way I feel [UNK]'

Terence: 'Yeah I know it's sad isn't it?'

[UNK]: 'Do you know what I mean?'

Terence: 'Yeah I do.
I do know what you'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'mean and I think it's, it's, it's a shame!
It's awful really!'

[UNK]: '[UNK] when I speak about it I get so upset that they've got three or four and they can't [UNK]!'

Terence: 'And that's right!'

[UNK]: 'You see.'

Terence: 'You can't!'

[UNK]: 'And there, lots of people and and lots of them actually they came from Abbotsbury and [UNK] that all their kids were doing so well and then this period of a year, nothing!
No progress!
No [UNK]!'

Terence: 'I know!
Well'

[UNK]: 'You know!
Nice to talk to you'

Terence: 'See you again.'

[UNK]: 'again.
Bye bye!'

Terence: 'Bye bye!'

Would you hold on a moment I'll just get Margaret to the phone cos she really deals with the bookings hold on a second!
Monsignor [UNK].
He wants the hall Ma March the twenty sixth I think.

Margaret: 'Hello Monsignor!

What does he, Botham opening big trumps'

Terence: 'Hicks is hoax.'

Margaret: 'Hoax.
Er, what does that mean do you think?'

Terence: 'Well it means that if if Botham does open then the only place for Hicks is in the middle taking Lamb's place so when Lamb comes back'

Margaret: 'He'll be out.'

Terence: 'he might not have a place.'

Terence: 'There's one here about British Gas complaints about British Gas rose a hundred and thirty four percent last year according to the recent Offgas report.
In one case a Leeds man received a quarterly bill for more than three thousand pounds after British Gas engineers fitted his new meter back to front!'

Margaret: 'Very funny!'

## 039616

Terence: 'Good gracious!
Times may be tough but it seems we're taking less care of our money than ever before.
According to the Royal Mint around twenty three thousand pounds of coins a day disappear!'

Terence: 'Some is taken home by tourist and some is lost in the street and down the backs of sofas.
But amazingly we are just as careless when it comes to bank notes.
Last November the old style fiver with the Duke of Wellington was withdrawn yet there are still sixty million missing!'

Margaret: 'You can understand sort of you know, th the coppers and that that as they say get down behind sofas and what have you but erm it is quite amazing where notes get to isn't it?'

Terence: 'Sixty million's a lot isn't it?'

Margaret: 'Yes.'

Terence: 'That's quite interesting that!
There's a mutilated notes department as well that you can send really screwed up notes to.'

Margaret: 'Yeah.
Haven't you heard before about that then?
But how I know, that's what somebody told me.
[UNK] to send some notes in [UNK]'

Margaret: 'Oh yes, sister made it'

Terence: 'Well I mean we can always unmake it presumably cos next week it will be, it'll be different time I expect won't it?
A natter about ten I'd expect won't it next week?'

Australia made a good start and we were a bit behind the eighth ball after'

Margaret: 'I don't really, I don't really'

Terence: 'Alan Ball admitted his men had it all to do after his men crashed to South Africa, the Australian wicket went for a duck as a defending champion slumped said we are going to have to do it the hard way now, we just didn't play very, we didn't get it together against New Zealand in the first match and today we were never in the picture, our brothers never really had a chance of any attempt of a hundred and seventy, but full credit to South Africa they are a rate, a better to side'

Margaret: 'There we go, mm'

Terence: 'still at least we've won one game'

Margaret: 'Well perhaps it needn't where he just had plenty of porridge'

Terence: 'Yeah, yes'

Margaret: 'Now I should be'

Margaret: 'should prefer cutting my hair, I'm not gonna have it cut quite so short this time I think'

So where did you go from here?'

Right right, so let us see what we can do shall we?
Erm where do we start?'

Lucy: 'I need a'

Terence: 'there yeah,'

Lucy: 'Yeah'

Terence: 'E two, now you've got to work out the average speed, right try and think roughly what the answer would be, because if you thought of that, then you would know that's a silly answer, cos look, how far is the journey?'

Lucy: 'A hundred and twenty miles'

Terence: 'Right, well say, a nice, you know just to the nearest, to the nearest erm whole number'

Lucy: 'A hundred'

Terence: 'Right'

Lucy: 'and twenty seven miles'

Terence: 'A hundred and twenty seven, what's that to the nearest hour?'

Lucy: 'Two hours'

Terence: 'Right, so if it goes say a hundred and twenty six miles or a hundred and twenty miles, to the nearest ten miles, it goes a hundred and twenty miles in two hours how far would it go in one hour?'

Lucy: 'Sixty'

Terence: 'Right, sixty so that can't be right can it?
Right, so how are you gonna find the average speed, what do you do to find that average speed?
You divide what by what?'

Lucy: 'Divide that by that'

Terence: 'Right, but, what are you gonna divide that by on a calculator?'

Lucy: 'Two point twelve'

Terence: 'No, this is the whole thing isn't it?
Don't you remember look if there were a hundred minutes in an hour that would be two point one two, but there's not a hundred minutes in an hour are there?
How many minutes are there in an hour?'

Lucy: 'Sixty'

Terence: 'Right, now look, it says there, so what's twelve minutes?'

Lucy: 'Nought point two'

Terence: 'Right, so what are you gonna divide that by to get the average speed?'

Lucy: 'Twelve point two'

Terence: 'No'

Lucy: 'Nought point'

Terence: 'what's the time?'

Lucy: 'Erm two hours and twelve minutes'

Terence: 'Right, how do you write that as a decimal of an hour?
What's two hours, twelve minutes?
Look you've got two hours and you've got twelve minutes, now what fraction of an hour is twelve minutes?'

Lucy: 'Erm five'

Terence: 'No, what, twelve minutes is what fraction of an hour?'

Lucy: 'Oh, nought point two'

Terence: 'Right, so that equals the minutes is point two, how many hours?'

Lucy: 'Two'

Terence: 'So two hours, twelve minutes is two point two'

Lucy: 'Two'

Terence: 'hours'

Lucy: 'Yeah'

Terence: 'Right, so to find the average speed what you gonna do?'

Lucy: 'Two hours divided by'

Terence: 'Right, but and what that by'

Lucy: 'That divide by that'

Terence: 'divide, come on say again'

Lucy: 'That'

Terence: 'That by, by what?'

Lucy: 'Two point two'

Terence: 'Right'

Lucy: 'Fifty eight'

Terence: 'That's right right, well what about the next one?'

Lucy: 'Doesn't say'

Terence: 'Well how many minutes is it?'

Lucy: 'Nought point nine five'

Lucy: 'nought point nine five'

Terence: 'Where does fifty eight come?'

Lucy: 'There'

Terence: 'Does it?'

Lucy: 'No'

Terence: 'Right, there, so what are you gonna divide it by?'

Lucy: 'Mm'

Terence: 'That's nought point eight, nought point nine, nought point nine five, nought point nine'

Lucy: 'Six'

Terence: 'six and that's half way to it so that's nought point nine, six, five'

Lucy: 'Five'

Terence: 'Look, nought point nine, six, five and so you're gonna divide'

Lucy: 'Five'

Terence: 'you're gonna divide fifty point five by'

Lucy: 'Fifty two'

Terence: 'Right right now D'

Lucy: 'Well that one point two'

Terence: 'That's right'

Lucy: 'forty two'

Terence: 'Right right, now, the next one'

Lucy: 'Er how you gonna take it out of it?
Three at, thirty nine'

Lucy: 'thirty nine'

Terence: 'So what is it?'

Lucy: 'Two hours, thirty nine minutes'

Terence: 'Right, two hours, thirty nine, right'

Lucy: 'Two point six, five'

Terence: 'Right'

Lucy: 'Seventy two'

Terence: 'Right'

Lucy: 'I've got erm, how many hours and all this written down at home if you want me to bring that up'

Terence: 'Erm'

Lucy: 'write all the hours down'

Terence: 'Yes you can do'

Two fourteen to ten twenty, er this again is easier because what would be two fourteen to ten fourteen?'

Lucy: 'Erm eight'

Lucy: 'Erm seven hours'

Terence: 'Right, now you've got to go from fifty to twenty nine'

Lucy: 'Erm'

Terence: 'so fifty to an hour would be'

Lucy: 'Thirty nine'

Terence: 'Right thirty nine minutes, so it's'

Lucy: 'Seven, eight hours'

Terence: 'No seven hours isn't it?'

Lucy: 'Seven hours'

Terence: 'Two to nine, seven hours and thirty nine minutes isn't it?'

Lucy: 'Got thirty nine'

Terence: 'Right, now this next one ten A M to two thirty seven P M, well what's ten o'clock?'

Lucy: 'Four hours'

Terence: 'Four hours and?'

Lucy: 'Fifty seven'

Terence: 'Right and I think the next one you got right, because you worked it out alright, cos it's seven days, which is how many hours?'

Lucy: 'Five, three, erm seven times twenty four'

Terence: 'That's right, which is?'

Lucy: 'Erm a hundred times twenty four'

Terence: 'Well it's a hundred and sixty eight, seven times twenty four, but then you've got five hours to add onto it which makes it a hundred and seventy three, right, so now work out your average speeds.'

Lucy: 'Okay but I got some right, I got the actual question wrong on that one, just I, shall I do that one?'

Terence: 'Have you got the second one, didn't you get the second one, oh you got that one wrong?'

Lucy: 'Yes'

Terence: 'Right, so yes, do that one this is what this is Dublin to Cork?'

Lucy: 'Erm one hundred and ten, no one hundred and twenty'

Terence: 'Dublin to Cork, it's two hundred and sixty six'

Lucy: 'Oh I've done the wrong one a hundred and six, I've got that and you've marked it wrong'

Terence: 'What did you divide by?'

Lucy: 'That'

Terence: 'What?'

Lucy: 'Two point five, eight'

Terence: 'What's two point five hours?'

Lucy: 'Erm a hundred and'

Terence: 'Well what's point five of an hour?'

Lucy: 'Six'

Terence: 'What, what fraction is point five?
Point five something, what fraction is that?'

Lucy: 'Point five?'

Terence: 'Yeah point five'

Lucy: 'Half'

Terence: 'Right, what's half an hour?'

Lucy: 'Thirty nine'

Terence: 'Right, so two point five is two hours, thirty minutes, but it's not two hours, thirty minutes, it's two hours'

Lucy: 'Fifty minutes'

Terence: 'Right, so what have you got to do?
You've got to change the minutes to a decimal'

Lucy: 'Oh'

Terence: 'haven't you?'

Lucy: 'Eight, eight point eight, three'

Terence: 'Right'

Lucy: 'What did I say, point eight three?
Ninety four'

Terence: 'Right'

Lucy: 'erm'

Terence: 'Right, now what's the next one?'

Lucy: 'erm Switzerland'

Terence: 'Switzerland, right'

Lucy: 'Eight there, nought, point, one, three'

Terence: 'Right'

Lucy: 'Did I say nought, point, eight, three?'

Terence: 'No'

Lucy: 'Nought, point, one, three'

Terence: 'Right'

Lucy: 'Nought, point, one, three'

Terence: 'but you're not gonna divide by nought, point, one, three are you?'

Lucy: 'No ninety one'

Terence: 'Right now what I shall do before you go any further is divide that at the side here, what those and minutes are as decimals of an hour'

Lucy: 'Nought point four, seven, nought point four, seven'

Terence: 'What was it erm six hours twenty eight minutes was it?'

Lucy: 'Yes six point nought, what did I say?'

Terence: 'Yeah'

Lucy: 'Six point three, seven'

Terence: 'No, four, seven isn't it?'

Lucy: 'Yeah'

Terence: 'Right'

Lucy: 'Nought point one six, five nought, point, four, two'

Terence: 'No, how long is it?'

Lucy: 'Twenty seven'

Terence: 'Is it twenty seven?'

Lucy: 'Yes'

Terence: 'Which one we dealing with?'

Lucy: 'Britain'

Terence: 'Right, no it's not, look, it's ten o'clock to two thirty seven, what's that?
How many minutes?'

Lucy: 'Thirty seven'

Terence: 'Right, so it's four hours, thirty seven minutes isn't it?
We want thirty seven'

Lucy: 'Nought point six, two'

Terence: 'Right'

Lucy: 'ninety eight'

Terence: 'Right'

Lucy: 'eighty six'

Terence: 'Eighty, you're not far out, but it's just erm'

Terence: 'Madrid to Barcelona'

Terence: 'six, eight, seven'

Lucy: 'Erm, eight six'

Terence: 'Right just don't do it again'

Lucy: 'Six'

Terence: 'Is this the seven hours, thirty nine minutes?'

Lucy: 'Yeah, six, eight, seven'

Terence: 'Seven hours'

Lucy: 'seven'

Terence: 'thirty nine minutes'

Lucy: 'Twenty six'

Terence: 'five'

Lucy: 'Five, no I do it the wrong way'

Terence: 'Right, start again, eight hundred and, no it were doing'

Lucy: 'I'm doing Spain, that's what I'm doing anyway, oh I've got that one right'

Terence: 'Right, so West Germany'

Lucy: 'One hundred and six'

Terence: 'Right'

Lucy: 'One, three, seven'

Terence: 'Right right, what you didn't do almost all the time was to change those minutes to decimals of an hour wasn't it?
So you must remember that whenever you're dealing with speed or anything to do with hours and minutes you've got to change your minutes to the decimals of an hour before you can use your calculator.'

Lucy: 'Okay.'

Terence: 'Now, just let's have a little help here, because you won't have this graph with you all the time will you?'

Lucy: 'No'

Terence: 'Right, so, how can you find out what forty minutes is?'

Lucy: 'Divide it by ten'

Terence: 'No, what decimal fraction of an hour is forty minutes?
How can you find out, you can use your calculator'

Lucy: 'Quarter, three quarters'

Terence: 'No, what's, what's a quarter of an hour?'

Lucy: 'Quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, fours into sixty, fifteen'

Terence: 'Right, so three quarters of an hour is?'

Lucy: 'Forty five'

Terence: 'Forty five minutes if you've got forty five minutes, what's, what's the fraction of an hour?'

Lucy: 'Over sixty'

Terence: 'Right, it's forty five over sixty, you want to change that into a decimal, what do you do?'

Lucy: 'Erm divide into'

Terence: 'No, how do you change any fraction into a decimal, now this is something you must'

Lucy: 'Divide it by ten'

Terence: 'No, no, no, no you've got fractions here look, erm now how do you change all those fractions into decimal fractions, what do you do?'

Lucy: 'Nought point five'

Terence: 'But how did you do it?
You knew that, but how do you do it?'

Lucy: 'Erm'

Terence: 'How do you do it on a calculator?
What does that really mean one over two, how else could you write one over two?
How else could you write it?'

Lucy: 'Two over four'

Terence: 'Yes, but I don't mean that, erm, could you, would you write it as one plus two or one minus two or one multiplied by two or one divided by two'

Lucy: 'One multiplied'

Terence: 'One multiplied by two?
Two ones are two?
Does a half equal two?
So what does that, you know this, which of those four rules do you do for that?'

Lucy: 'One'

Terence: 'What's one plus two?'

Lucy: 'Three'

Terence: 'What's one minus two?'

Lucy: 'Nothing, minus'

Terence: 'one, minus two?'

Lucy: 'One, no, nothing'

Terence: 'One, minus two'

Lucy: 'Minus two'

Terence: 'Minus, one, come down two, come down one you get to nought, come down another one'

Lucy: 'Minus two'

Terence: 'so one minus one, one minus two is?'

Lucy: 'Minus one'

Terence: 'Is minus one, what's one times two?'

Lucy: 'Er two'

Terence: 'What's one divided by two?'

Lucy: 'One'

Terence: 'If you've got one apple and you divide it'

Lucy: 'Half'

Terence: 'Right, one divided by two is a half, so which of those answers is that one?
Right, so what does one, how else can you write one over two?'

Lucy: 'Erm one divide'

Terence: 'One divided by two, right, remember that, so how can I write that?'

Lucy: 'Forty five divided by six'

Terence: 'By?'

Lucy: 'Sixty'

Terence: 'Right, do that on your calculator'

Lucy: 'Nought point seven five'

Terence: 'Right, so that equals nought point seven five, what's a half?
Do it on the calculator'

Lucy: 'Nought point five'

Terence: 'Right what's three quarters divided er as a decimal?'

Lucy: 'Nought point five nought point eight, seven, five'

Terence: 'Right, so how do you change a fraction into a decimal?'

Lucy: 'You divide it by the bottom'

Terence: 'You divide the top number by the bottom number, so, supposing you've got fifty seven minutes and you want to change that into a decimal of an hour, what fraction of an hour is it?
What's fifty seven minutes as a deci as a fraction of an hour?
That's forty five minutes'

Lucy: 'Fifty seven over sixty'

Terence: 'Right, so how do you change that into a decimal?'

Lucy: 'Nought, point, nine, five'

Terence: 'Right, nought, point, nine, five, so now you can see how easily you can change your minutes into a decimal at any time, right, now, let's look at some of these, this is four hours and thirty'

Lucy: 'Thirty'

Terence: 'seven minutes, so it's four hours, four hours and thirty seven minutes, so what fraction is that of an hour?'

Lucy: 'Erm'

Terence: 'Thirty seven minutes?'

Lucy: 'Forty'

Terence: 'Thirty seven minutes?'

Lucy: 'over sixty'

Terence: 'Right thirty seven over sixty, what's thirty seven over sixty?
Cos the ans that is four and thirty seven sixtieths'

Lucy: 'Mm'

Terence: 'so what's thirty seven sixtieths as a decimal?'

Lucy: 'Nought point six'

Terence: 'Right, so what's four hours, thirty seven minutes?'

Lucy: 'Four point six'

Terence: 'Point six'

Lucy: 'O'

Terence: 'Well six'

Lucy: 'One'

Terence: 'to the nearest two decimal places what's that gonna be?
Nought, point, six'

Lucy: 'Nought, point, six one'

Terence: 'to do decimal places?'

Lucy: 'Oh, two'

Terence: 'Right, because that's bigger than five isn't it?'

Lucy: 'Yes'

Terence: 'So it's nought, point, six, two, so for our thirty seven minutes it's, four point six, two, there we are look, but the thing is you can now do it without having to look at a scale'

Lucy: 'Mm'

Terence: 'Right?'

Lucy: 'Mm'

Terence: 'So do this one what is this?'

Lucy: 'Four'

Terence: 'Eight hours and four minutes'

Lucy: 'Four, six'

Terence: 'So, so what's that gonna be, eight hours and four minutes?'

Lucy: 'Nought point nought'

Terence: 'It's, it's eight hours'

Lucy: 'Yes'

Terence: 'so it's gonna be eight not nought isn't it?'

Lucy: 'Mm'

Terence: 'It's gonna be eight point'

Lucy: 'Nought one'

Terence: 'Nought what?'

Lucy: 'One'

Terence: 'Nought one, what's that?'

Lucy: 'Mm, erm nought'

Terence: 'Nought, six, six, so it's gonna be to two decimal places it's gonna be'

Lucy: 'Nought point nought seven'

Terence: 'Right, so it's gonna be eight point'

Lucy: 'Nought seven'

Terence: 'eighty point, nought, seven right'

Lucy: 'Yeah'

Terence: 'So you now know how you can change your minutes to decimals'

Lucy: 'To decimals'

Terence: 'Right, now you may have to do that on this next one'

Lucy: 'Tired'

Terence: 'I can see that'

Lucy: 'Oh my brother does motor racing'

Terence: 'I know he does Have you heard from your brother?'

Lucy: 'Yeah'

Terence: 'How is he?'

Lucy: 'He's okay, he says the resorts are very good'

Terence: 'Does he and the snow good?'

Lucy: 'Yeah'

Terence: 'And has he been up to the top of the'

Lucy: 'I don't know I wasn't there when mummy'

Terence: 'oh I see so what's today Thursday, he's only got today and tomorrow left hasn't he for skiing'

Lucy: 'That's Silverstone'

Terence: 'That's right'

Lucy: 'Yes I know where that is'

Terence: 'Do you?'

Lucy: 'Yes'

Terence: 'Have you been there?'

Lucy: 'No, my brother has'

Terence: 'Has he?'

Lucy: 'He might have I don't, he probably has'

Terence: 'Right so it shows a Silverstone motor racing circuit'

Lucy: 'Yeah'

Terence: 'Right, so what's the first'

Lucy: 'circuit has five corners and ten kerbs, car start'

Lucy: 'ha, car start near Woodcape Corner and go clockwise, which corner do they come from first?'

Lucy: 'aha Copse Corner'

Terence: 'Right Copse Corner what would you expect to find at Copse Corner?'

Lucy: 'Ten cops'

Terence: 'And what's a copse?'

Lucy: 'I don't know'

Terence: 'That's what I wanted to find out'

Terence: 'You don't know what copse is?'

Lucy: 'No'

Terence: 'A copse is a smallish group of trees'

Lucy: 'Is there lots of trees there?'

Terence: 'Well there would be, yes, I would imagine or if they certainly would, they would of been in the past, they may have been cut down, but that would indicate to me that there were probably trees'

Lucy: 'Probably been cut down'

Terence: 'at that corner, a group of trees'

Lucy: 'Mm'

Terence: 'Copse Corner, copse er, is, is a name which we give to a small wood, a small group of trees is a copse, in India that can be called a shola, S H O L A'

Lucy: 'Mm'

Terence: 'and at one stage when I was walking in India we used to stay at bungalows and one was called Marian Shola and another was called Pine Shola, because it meant that it was a, it was a bungalow in a group of pine trees'

Lucy: 'Mm'

Terence: 'but copse is a small group of trees, right, so, the next one B'

Lucy: 'Which curve is just after Beckett?
Chapel kerb'

Terence: 'Chapel kerb'

Lucy: 'Wonder who's got a Chapel there?'

Terence: 'I should think almost certainly there was a chapel at that point'

Lucy: 'Famous people go there'

Terence: 'Oh they do indeed, yes'

Lucy: 'Mm, mm which corner is at the end of Hammer Street?
Stow Corner'

Terence: 'That's right'

Lucy: 'Why is that called Stow?'

Terence: 'I wouldn't know that one'

Lucy: 'Banker's got a nice track'

Terence: 'I hate to think what was in that corner too'

Lucy: 'Ugh'

Terence: 'Oh dear, right'

Lucy: 'Look, I have a magic pencil'

Terence: 'You have a magic pencil'

Lucy: 'It moves'

Terence: 'mm'

Lucy: 'Car going from Woodcape to Copse who'

Terence: 'To Copse'

Lucy: 'Car will be travelling roughly from west to east or eastwards'

Terence: 'Yes, now remember that, what that means, west to east is in fact going eastwards'

Lucy: 'Yes'

Terence: 'Where would it be travelling roughly southwards?'

Lucy: 'Where am I going from Woodcape southwards, that way'

Terence: 'Which is southwards?'

Lucy: 'Down'

Terence: 'Right, so where would the car be travelling in a southward direction?'

Lucy: 'There'

Terence: 'Right, so how would you describe that stretch, it's going from'

Lucy: 'Copse Corner to'

Terence: 'right'

Lucy: 'Oh there we go'

Terence: 'Right, so where would it be going, roughly going'

Lucy: 'going northwards'

Terence: 'Northwards'

Lucy: 'Going up'

Terence: 'So where would that be from?'

Lucy: 'There'

Terence: 'There to?'

Lucy: 'to Woodcape Corner'

Terence: 'Right'

[UNK]: 'No, come on.'

Margaret: 'Oh we know it.'

[UNK]: 'Tuesday the seventh when, I've just got to write it in my book you see because I haven't gone that far ahead.'

Margaret: 'Ah'

Terence: 'Ah'

[UNK]: 'What's Thursday, the ninth isn't it?'

Margaret: 'Thursday is the ninth, yes.'

[UNK]: 'That's next week.'

Terence: 'That's the ninth of April'

Margaret: 'Ninth of April.'

Terence: 'That looks alright.'

[UNK]: 'Okay?'

Margaret: 'Right.'

[UNK]: 'Should [UNK] try the [UNK] again.'

Margaret: 'Don't worry though honestly, I know these things do happen.'

Terence: 'What time?'

Margaret: 'Quarter to ten.
We've gone and got lumbered'

[UNK]: 'A bit waylaid.'

Terence: 'Did you?
Well it happens doesn't it?
I mean'

Margaret: 'She went to do a lady's hair and then the lady said well if you, could you just sort of trim my husband's.'

[UNK]: 'husband's'

Terence: 'Okay.'

Margaret: 'Look forward to seeing you again in six weeks time.'

[UNK]: 'Lovely thanks'

Margaret: 'Okay then?
Bye bye.'

Terence: 'Bye bye.
Well they're a hundred and forty six now.
Oh I hope Hicks gets his fifty.'

Terence: 'He's got forty six now.'

Margaret: 'He's got forty six?'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'Gooch was stumped.'

Margaret: 'Was he?'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Margaret: 'Oh [UNK]'

Terence: 'Well shall we have a cup of coffee before we go out?'

Margaret: 'What?'

Terence: 'Shall we have a cup of coffee before we go out?'

Margaret: 'Yes may as well might [UNK]'

Terence: 'Oh yes that's true, yes, I'll put the kettle on.'

Margaret: '[UNK] said all I'm worried about is did I wash my hair too early for you so she said it's alright I've got a spray that I can sort of cos she likes it quite wet when she'

Terence: 'Yeah.
It's thirty eight overs so I mean they've got another twelve overs yet.'

Margaret: 'To get about twenty runs.'

Terence: 'Ten runs oh no less than that, ten runs now.'

Margaret: 'Ten?'

Terence: 'Well twelve I think, hundred and forty six they've got now.'

Margaret: 'Oh that would be twelve then.'

Terence: 'They're just obviously between overs at the moment, it's just finished an over and they've got the bowler up.
Hundred and fifty, Dick Hicks got his fifty.'

Margaret: 'Oh good.
Fairbrother's doing, you know, he's holding up the other'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Margaret: 'side obviously.
Was Lucy sort of late with you?
Or did she have to go back for something.'

Terence: 'She had to go back for something.'

Margaret: 'I, cos I saw her at a quarter past nine so'

Terence: 'No no she'd erm she'd been in, hundred and fifty three, Hick again.'

Margaret: 'Hundred and fifty three, so he only wants five?'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Margaret: 'Oh well let him hit the the winning thing.'

Terence: 'Well he won't be er he, he won't, he won't have strike now, Fairbrother will have strike.
Cos he's obviously just got a three.'

Margaret: 'Unless they've changed ends.
Thirty eight overs, yes, as you say they've got another twelve overs.
Hundred and fifty four'

Terence: 'Oh he's got one yes.'

Margaret: 'so he had four cos he got one then didn't he?'

Terence: 'Mm.'

Margaret: 'Oh well the jubilation [UNK]'

Terence: 'Hundred and fifty six.'

Margaret: 'So only wants two and he's got fifty six look you see'

Terence: 'Mm.'

Margaret: 'he's doing the scoring.
Well I expect they like him doing it.
Fifty four, it's changed, Hick's not out fifty four it was fifty six a minute ago wasn't it?'

Terence: 'Yes it was, Fairbrother's got the nine you see, look.'

Margaret: 'Yeah well he's still got nine.'

Terence: 'Yeah but he had seven.'

Margaret: 'Oh I thought it was nine he had.'

Terence: 'No.'

Margaret: 'So they only want two.
Six six four oh no'

Terence: 'No'

Margaret: 'not quite, no.'

Terence: 'Something's come up which shouldn't have done.'

Margaret: 'Well switch it off and bring it up again and see if it changes.'

Terence: 'Oh it will change again as soon as it goes round to the, to the three four one again er y you don't see it changing it but'

Margaret: 'Oh I know, every time it flicks'

Terence: 'Yeah mm'

Margaret: 'it's changing.
You see it, I mean I pointed that out, like now.
For four wickets, oh Hick caught and bowled!'

Terence: 'Oh dear.'

Margaret: 'Oh.'

Terence: 'Probably trying to, probably trying to hit a six out of the ground'

Margaret: 'Should think probably that was probably what that erm'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Margaret: '[UNK] was about probably [UNK]'

## 039802

Margaret: '[UNK] caught and bowled he was probably was sort of erm'

Terence: 'Just trying to hit a six.'

Margaret: 'trying to hit, you know, get it finished.'

Terence: 'That's right.'

Margaret: 'Yes erm she didn't come till after ten and I was beginning'

Terence: 'Yeah'

Margaret: 'to wonder whether I'd got the right time.'

Terence: 'Have we got a p is there a piece of cake left?'

Margaret: 'Sorry?'

Terence: 'Is there a piece of cake left?'

Margaret: 'What did you say?'

Terence: 'I said is there a p no it's alright, a biscuit will do fine.
I just said was there a piece of cake left.'

Margaret: 'Oh there is ca oh of course I have got cakes in the [UNK].
Oh gosh, help me, help me, help me.
Good, not out [UNK] [UNK] bowling again.
Presumably you took those chicken things downstairs for me yesterday?'

Terence: 'Presumably I did.'

Margaret: 'You know the [UNK]'

Terence: 'Yes I think I did, yeah.
The what?'

Terence: 'Oh yes I put them in the freezer, yes, yes.'

Terence: 'I was trying to think of rubbish that I'd taken out.
Do you want a bit of cake?'

Margaret: 'I, I'd just taken this thing'

Terence: 'You're not gonna have a piece of this?'

Margaret: 'Oh you can have, you can finish that up if you want to.'

Terence: 'Thanks.
Oh they're taking a long time to get these last two runs aren't they?'

Terence: 'Mm.'

Margaret: '[UNK] look.'

Terence: 'Oh gracious.'

Margaret: '[UNK] Fairbrother got a four look.'

Terence: 'Oh yes.
Well we've eleven overs to spare, I mean that's erm'

Margaret: '[UNK] England's maintaining their [UNK] Britain and the West Indies in one day games [UNK]'

Terence: 'Six wicket victory, the West Indies batting self destructed after the loss of two early wickets and only [UNK] at fifty four and [UNK] scores.
They were all out for just a hundred and fifty seven and the outcome was never in doubt after Graham Gooch and Ian Botham [UNK] an opening stand of fifty in reply.
Gooch made sixty five, Graham Hicks boost boosted his confidence with his second international fifty and England reached their target with ten overs to spare.
Well I think they w they were something on three four two I think.
Now that was ma that will be in the score card of course, three four two.'

Margaret: 'Oh this is it look. [UNK]'

Terence: 'England [UNK] bowling [UNK] West Indies course for their second cup victory [UNK] on their back caught by snaring [UNK] in his opening [UNK]'

Margaret: '[UNK] of course'

Terence: 'caught Botham bowled Botham'

Margaret: 'he's doing alright.'

Terence: 'Mm.
Oh'

Margaret: 'How did it go?'

Terence: 'It went er on its own accord er now what number were we on?
Three four two.
So I'll go to three four three because I think there's something else on, someone else result.'

Margaret: '[UNK] details.
Was there [UNK] last night?
Oh no that was the night before [UNK]'

Terence: '[UNK] picked up their first points with a fifty three one o w win over Zimbabwe'

Margaret: 'Oh is that [UNK]?'

Terence: 'Pakistan'

Margaret: 'Oh I see, he, he was the opener.'

Terence: 'He was docked four times on his way to reaching his first one day century.
Oh, so Pakistan'

Terence: 'beat Zimbabwe.'

Margaret: 'Oh it was Pakistan was it?'

Terence: 'Mm.
Now what was that about Food and Drink you wanted to see?'

Margaret: 'No I was, I just saw Food and Drink'

Terence: 'Oh.'

Margaret: 'but I think I saw it, didn't I, the night before last was it?'

Terence: 'Yes I think you did didn't you?'

Margaret: 'They haven't got news yet of the erm cricket win I don't suppose?'

Terence: 'No.
Well it won't be on the national news I don't suppose cos it comes under sports'

Margaret: 'Oh it'll be on the national news because'

Terence: 'thing mm'

Margaret: 'they [UNK] reporting it.'

## 039803

Terence: 'Well I've got one of France but I'm not sure what scale it is.
I don't th'

Margaret: 'You see if we had seen that one that would be very ideal for Richard.'

Terence: 'Yes it would.
Erm erm'

Margaret: 'Doesn't it tell you?'

Terence: '[UNK] now you see this is three inches to the mile and this is this is one to no that's not one to a million, that's ridiculous that is.
Erm [UNK] have to work it out all the time, this is erm this is one to two hundred and fifty thousand.
Erm'

Margaret: 'This is three miles to one inch, that one isn't it?'

Terence: 'Yes this one is, look this one is erm that's ten kilometres is eight miles isn't it?'

Margaret: 'Yes mhm.'

Terence: 'So that's eight miles, that's, so that's, this is about four miles to the inch, this one I should think.
So it's not bad you see, so I mean I've got that one of France which is'

Margaret: 'Yes so that's okay.'

Terence: 'more or less the s'

Margaret: 'So the other one is I don't remember what it is I wanted but I think I'll go in to erm [UNK] and erm [UNK]'

Terence: 'Well I've got to go to the building society and I've got to go to'

Margaret: 'The bank.'

Terence: 'the bank.
Erm'

Terence: 'I'll go down and get the car out.'

## 039804

Terence: 'It's really quite warm now out sort of out of the wind.'

Margaret: 'Yes [UNK] well I think that the erm I mean the sun is a surprise.'

Terence: 'Yeah.
Yeah that tub of daffs is really erm looking good isn't it?'

Margaret: 'Mm [UNK] They look as if they're all planted near the top you know'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Margaret: 'as if you put a whole heap of as you say th the t the two of them [UNK]'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Margaret: 'in the wheelbarrow [UNK]'

Terence: 'Yeah, both out, yeah'

Margaret: 'sort of'

Terence: 'So we just wanna go and park somewhere don't we really?'

Margaret: 'Well really it's about it I'll have to see if there's a carrier [UNK]'

Terence: 'I think there is one in the box, yes.'

Margaret: 'If we put one back in again.
I haven't got as much room in this one to put the bag.'

Terence: 'Have you not?
No.'

Margaret: 'Gosh'

Terence: 'Mm Oh the moor is visible again.'

Margaret: 'Yeah.
Oh well perhaps the fog and erm [UNK] got a appointment on the Saturday hasn't she?'

Terence: 'Has she?
For hair'

Margaret: '[UNK] hair'

Terence: 'Yeah.'

Margaret: 'and erm well perhaps young Bob and Jess can go on the moor on Saturday.'

Terence: 'Yes'

Margaret: 'If it, I mean if it were like today it will be lovely.'

Terence: 'Yeah.
Yes well I hope we get the opportunity.'

Margaret: 'Yeah.'

Terence: 'Gosh that car looks a bit rusty doesn't it?
That's a Fiat of course you see.'

Margaret: 'Oh yes, yeah'

Terence: 'It's like Richard's old car, you remember that, Fiat?'

Margaret: '[UNK] Fiat one two seven like that one is.'
