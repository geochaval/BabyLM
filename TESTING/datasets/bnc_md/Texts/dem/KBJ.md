Emma: 'Right.'

Chris: 'is twenty one and do it that way, five and fives.
Okay?
Two addition questions.'

Emma: 'Hang on.'

Chris: 'Two ad yeah but you've got right two multiple and two addition equations.'

Emma: 'Not equations!
You told us this!'

Chris: 'But i thi, like these, these are equations.
So two addition equations er three times se seven plus seven plus seven is twenty one.
Right?
Oh!
A so, but you can also go'

Emma: 'Yeah.
Yeah add three.'

Chris: 'Three plus three plus three plus three plus three plus three is twenty one.
Do it that way on.
Do you follow'

That's right.'

Emma: 'And you do the same there.'

Chris: 'Same on the adds.'

Emma: 'And then, this we do like'

Chris: 'Right, she wants currency in two divisions in each, right?
So it's one, two, three, four, fi'

Emma: 'That multiplication is a'

Chris: 'yeah well divisions, okay, so it's twenty one shared by say, if that's one, two, three, four, five, six int it?'

Emma: 'Oh I know what I've got!'

Chris: 'Six times three is eighteen or three times six is eighteen.'

Emma: 'I know what I've done.
I've put the, I thought it was er okay.
Six.'

Chris: 'And division is shared by.
So you got to do eighteen shared by six is three and eighteen'

Emma: 'Have you got'

Chris: 'shared by three is six.'

Emma: 'So like, you go one, two, three, four, five, six six times you swap'

Chris: 'Three.'

Emma: 'six times three'

Chris: 'times three is eighteen'

Emma: 'is three times six.'

Chris: 'Six.
Yeah, and and you got'

Emma: 'Six times three and three times six.'

Chris: 'A and division is eighteen shared by three is six, and eighteen shared by six is three!
Yeah?
Got it?'

Emma: 'I cannot read [UNK].'

Chris: 'Three sixes are eighteen!
You got it?'

Emma: 'And you do the same there?
Hang on!
I haven't finished thirty three'

Emma: 'one yet.
That's what I don't get.
Why do multiplication equation for this similar line I don't a get how you do that?
Is it, would you like us to put'

Chris: 'It's fours int it?
It's fours'

Emma: 'No two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve'

Chris: 'Yeah.
It'

It's going to fours.'

Emma: 'Alright.'

Chris: 'Going into fours.'

Emma: 'What would I put?'

Chris: 'Er one four is four, two fours are eight, and thre three fours is twelve.
As this is been shared by lines int it?'

Emma: 'Yeah and it's on that one.
You do it like that do you?'

Chris: 'Yeah, cos it's being shared by'

Emma: 'Oh!'

Chris: 'So it's, I would say that is er nine times four equals thirty six.
And on that one is er, sixty three shared by nine six time sixty three divided by nine'

Emma: '[UNK] four.'

Chris: 'No!
Sixty three divided by nine is six!
Write six through it.
Ten six [UNK] innit?'

Emma: 'No, it's ten sixes.'

Chris: 'No, no wait a minute.
Nines.
What should nine times ten Emma?'

Emma: 'One nine is nine, two nines are eighteen, three nines are'

Four nines are thirty six, five nines are forty five, six nines fifty four, seven nine are sixty three.'

Emma: 'Oh thank you.'

Chris: 'Right.
Yeah, seven nines are sixty three.'

Emma: 'Hang on a minute!
Six nines are'

Chris: '[UNK] seven nines are sixty three.'

Emma: 'Hang on a minute!
Seven'

Chris: 'Seven nines are sixty three!'

Emma: 'Sixty three.'

Chris: 'Yeah.'

Emma: 'You work them out like that look.'

Chris: 'Yeah.
Well seven nines, well ee er, it takes you so long'

Emma: 'Look one, one nine is nine'

Chris: 'Yeah.'

Emma: 'Two nines are eighteen.'

Chris: 'So that one there is sixes into si thirty six.'

Emma: 'I know!
But I still don't get what you have to write!'

Chris: 'Well multiplication equation for this number line I would say is er I've already told you that.'

Emma: 'No, but I don't know what I have to, I have to write!'

Chris: 'Eight times four equals thirty six.'

Emma: 'Don't get it.'

Chris: 'Because it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven eight, no sorry, nine times four is thirty six.
Nine times four equals thirty six.
Like this look!'
