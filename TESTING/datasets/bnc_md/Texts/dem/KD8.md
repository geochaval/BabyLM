Mike: 'If it's been re-registered sort of thing, so there's a big line in cars all [UNK].
And the police engineers go round with his mate and he's looking at the engine numbers and the chassis numbers and all those bloody numbers inside the car and he's looking like and er the interviewer said oh and this woman's in for a shock!

But, the registrations if they can't prove it properly'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Mike: 'you get a Q plate on it questionable registration.'

Harold: '[UNK] they were digging the road [UNK]'

Harold: 'What you want [UNK]?'

Merielle: 'Oh, he's so ignorant!

Merielle: 'Yeah.'

Harold: 'No crisps?'

Martine: 'you were going on about that'

Merielle: 'they said'

Martine: 'you're bringing back that car.'

Merielle: 'when we send it back in a few days fitting, this job I says we'll want it early in the morning and you can have it in the afternoon, but we were going to spend the day in Liverpool, but you're dad said, I'm not being round all those shops all day, so I said ooh no!
And it was me, and I was due to have Nicola the next month, [UNK] at the beginning of May that the [UNK] and I said no, I said!
But what we'll do is take it there early in the morning, we'll get he back the bus back to Liverpool, we'll go to the pier head and we'll go on the ferry to New Brighton and there was me prattling all on at him and the next thing er, you di, we didn't know that, we thought we were on the main right of way street and your dad started to go across and I looked, your dad was driving, I was sitting beside him and coming towards us along this other road, which had the right of way but we didn't know was a little black mini, I was a ergh, ergh oh Harry, Harry!
Bashed your dad's side, the wing and we could see a policeman putting, it was pouring with rain and he was putting his er, big mac on and he should of been directing the traffic, he told us that, he come over to us and he was only young like [UNK] and he said, oh I'd just left, I was on duty here I'd just left to go and put my mac on!
Well that was no consolation to us was it!
So we swapped addresses with er, can't remember, it was a man middle-aged sort of man and er he then said ooh, well he said I still think that we were in the right in as much as if that policeman was supposed to have been directing traffic blah blah blah blah blah!
So, because we were in the A A he said you could have a ba, and we had to go to court, we had a summons for court, for careless driving, your dad and your dad said oh [UNK] so A A said you could have barrister, or our insurers said we could have a barrister our insurers, not the one with we're with now Norman [UNK], he was to do all the [UNK], said we could have this barrister and it was at Liverpool Crown Court and, it wasn't till a, and I was alright we we just got a bit of a shock, you know, we could drive the home it was the wing and what not.
But, I can hear that bang now, you never forget a noise like that!
But, this was just a bang, sort of knocked'

Mike: 'Ah.'

Merielle: 'it of the chap, he reckoned.
So, er Nicola was born and er the court either came up just before your dad had the [UNK] after Nicola was born, when she was a month old.
Now he might remember I think the court come just before the [UNK] after Nicola [UNK], and the car was going to because I know we had to go on the train to Liverpool and er, I'd gotta give evidence as well, they made such a palaver!
And, when we were in the court sitting in the corridor waiting, ooh, some horrible types there even then!
This policeman was having to give evidence and he'd come to talk, oh I see you've had the baby, cos he was talking to me [UNK] it had happened I said, oh what did you have blah blah blah, blah blah blah, but the little devil went in the witness box, he denied about not being there on duty about putting his mac on, ooh and [UNK] he'd never clapped eyes on barrister or a solicitor and they said he'll meet you before the case, so we had to go extra early meet this barrister and he never came [UNK] and so they took us in this little room in all his wig and his gown, we got, oh what happened?
What happened?
Yeah, and we explained and said that I was pregnant at the time and we said about the policeman, oh no trouble!
No trouble!
But, [UNK] the lot, you're dad still got fined!
I took, it was nine pound we thought, lot of money in those days for careless driving!'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Merielle: 'Yeah.
So we never forgot that.'

Martine: 'Mm.'

Mike: 'Yeah, I I [UNK]'

Harold: '[UNK] on the old [UNK].'

Merielle: 'So, needless to say I don't like them, but I'll show you on the A to Z where Upper Parliament Street is.'

## 031101

Will: 'One of the jobs we are doing is to identify what schemes they're planning that they won't need to build.'

Michael: 'That's not possible.'

Martine: 'If you need a larger one that that'

Will: 'That's what it says.'

Martine: 'I've got a'

Michael: 'No but'

Martine: 'template.'

Michael: '[UNK] on a bridge bit [UNK]'

Will: 'Why not?'

Michael: 'It's, it's that's really linked to do we need to do the Caernarvon link if we're doing the bypass?
Do they need to do the they've proposed that they [UNK] to bypass erm [UNK] if we're doing the Caernarvon bypass.
Well can they detrunk that bit?'

Will: 'Well it doesn't say that.'

Michael: 'Well can they detrunk that bit? [UNK]'

Will: '[UNK] responsibility not'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Will: 'theirs if they put the bypass in.'

Michael: 'So what came out of this, well it could be [UNK]'

Jim: 'So are they looking to build a bypass first?'

Will: 'The gut reaction this morning is we could end up with a bypass scheme at the end of it and no Caernarvon link.'

Michael: 'Oh that's no good is it?'

Will: 'Of course it is.
Cos we're still continuing designing a Caernarvon link [UNK].'

Michael: '[UNK] four percent fee [UNK].
Mind you it's, it's a smaller job.'

Will: 'What's smaller?'

Michael: 'Well if they're doing that then we s we're looking to make this a dual carriageway on the Richard [UNK] principle that if it's a trunk road it's worth building a dual, a dual carriageway.'

Will: 'If you can convince him on traffic grounds fair enough.'

Michael: 'So they're serious'

Will: 'Course the initial thing is we get some reaction back from this, this [UNK]'

Michael: 'so they're seriously looking to the trunk road network coming down [UNK] bypass and then going off round the Caernarvon bypass?'

Michael: 'Or is that just'

Will: 'That wasn't er Ray [UNK]'s view.
That was this other guy's view.
Based on this other scheme really he said oh yes.'

Michael: 'But which, whi which other guy?'

Will: 'This Ve Vernon whatever his name is.'

Michael: 'The [UNK] are proposing this.
They won't want that.
They wo they won't [UNK]'

Will: 'But the [UNK] the guy that's looking after the [UNK] schemes [UNK]'

Michael: 'Yeah.'

Will: '[UNK] guy.'

Michael: 'He's what?'

Will: 'He's looking after the [UNK] schemes for the leisure office.'

Michael: 'Oh!
Oh he wasn't from [UNK].
Sorry I thought he was'

Will: 'He was from the leisure office looking after the [UNK] [UNK].'

Michael: 'Right.
Got it.'

Will: 'That's what it's, he's interest [UNK]'

Michael: 'Right.
Yes.
Very good.
Well'

Will: 'Right.'

Michael: 'have a lovely meeting.
Seminar'

Will: 'I will yes.'

Michael: 'Er you're going on this thing at the end of the month?'

Will: 'Meetings yes.'

Michael: 'There'd appear to be [UNK] out of this office.'

Will: 'There seems to be an awful lot of us going, yeah.
I'll o I'll only be there Friday morning and Saturday.
I won't be there Friday afternoon since I'm taking my son to the dentist [UNK].'

Michael: 'I do wonder if it's really w er I mean'

Michael: 'Okay.
See you tomorrow.'

Will: 'You won't.
I'm in Chester all day tomorrow.'

Will: 'Manchester all day Wednesday.
L E C visit Thursday, Friday.'

Martine: 'Busy man.'

Michael: 'I'd better get me timesheet out of'

Will: 'It's signed.'

Michael: 'Oh it's signed.
Oh that's alright.
We don't want [UNK] bothering us do we?'

Martine: 'Er where were we?'

Michael: 'Mm?'

Martine: 'Where were we?'

Jim: 'We were drawing up plans.'

Michael: 'It looks as though we're gonna be doing some extra survey work.'

Martine: 'Mm.
Ah that's what I was saying what'

Michael: 'Yeah, now'

Martine: 'detail on roundabouts.'

Michael: 'right.
How much staff did we use?
Can, can you [UNK] The erm the Ormskirk'

Michael: 'Oh, that's a pity.
[UNK] track of methodology but [UNK]'

[UNK]: '[UNK] push to get Steve [UNK] today.'

[UNK]: '[UNK] Well I left a message with his [UNK] saying [UNK]'

Michael: 'Were any of these four arm rou it's a five arm roundabout isn't it?
Were any of these four arm roundabouts?'

[UNK]: 'Yes [UNK]'

Michael: 'We did that one didn't we?'

[UNK]: 'We need to do these [UNK]'

Martine: 'Yeah that was [UNK] roundabout.
That was a six arm.'

Michael: 'And we did that one.'

Martine: 'Yeah that was a'

Michael: 'That's five arms isn't it?'

Martine: 'five.'

Michael: 'What other ones did we do?
That one there?'

Martine: 'Hello Charlie.
We did, yeah, we did the [UNK] here.
That was a five arm.
Well these down here about fifteen or sixteen'

Michael: 'Oh yeah well th yeah'

Martine: 'the motorways were four arm.'

Michael: 'How many staff do we need to do that then?'

Martine: 'The full turn in count.'

Michael: 'Suppose, well supposing we count ins and outs and the'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Michael: 'sample.'

Martine: 'Right.
You need one t to where, where were, where we talking about now?
St David.
See you're gonna get some busier than others.'

Michael: 'Yes.'

Martine: 'If they were all as busy as each other you've gotta have one doing ins and one doing outs.
But on quiet roads, one person can do ins and outs.'

[UNK]: 'I'll er I'll [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Yeah just get something done and I'll be back [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Okay.'

[UNK]: 'And we'll go through it.'

Martine: 'On the Queensferry bypass, on the interchange there it was five hours.'

[UNK]: 'It's only really a four and a half hour roundabout isn't it?'

Michael: 'Yes but one is out and'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'Yeah.
So you can obviously that's gonna just be one person.
One person could do a two way on a quiet arm but the others are gonna need one person to do ins, one person to do outs.
And one person at each arm doing a sample.'

Michael: 'So you've got nine plus four Did we do a sample all day?'

Martine: 'No, just in the peak hours they're sampling.'

Michael: 'Didn't we do them off peak as well?
We should have done them off peak as well shouldn't we?'

Martine: 'I don't know.
I mean Jan did those.
I think it was just peak hours.'

Michael: 'Er It's gonna take thirteen people isn't it?'

Martine: 'Yeah, I mean if it was peaks only I mean there's nothing to stop me doing it.'

Michael: 'Well I appreciate that.
Or you use it, you put everybody on in the peaks'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Michael: 'and then you, you'

Martine: 'You use the'

Michael: 'cutback'

Martine: 'In the off, in the off peak they rotate the staff and'

Michael: 'I'm not The thing is what you're assuming then is that the pattern in the peak hour is typical for the day as a whole.
That's not right is it?'

Martine: 'Mm maybe not.'

Michael: 'Well you'll get a different pattern in the morning peak and the evening peak for a start won't you?'

Martine: 'Mhm.'

Michael: 'Mind you maybe you won't.
Depends, what you're really concerned about is how does the proportion of traffic split to left and right and straight ahead isn't it?
If that pattern basically stays the same then you've got, the volume, the flow will go up and down.
Mm right.
But if we did a full turning count how would we do that?
You can't do it can you?'

Martine: 'It's not realistic.
You have to do if you're doing that you have to have all the ins and outs plus a circulation flow.'

Michael: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'And I've never done one like that.
We've always you know, found a way round it.'

Michael: 'What we did before, was we did counting in flows and circulating.
I think what we would do supposing we didn't, supposing we just had heavy vehicles and light vehicles?
That's gonna make things a lot easier isn't it?'

Martine: 'Yeah well we, for Queensferry we just had three classes.
Motorbikes, cars, light goods H G V including two three and four axle and buses for the, for the whole count, now for the samples Rob didn't even want it classified.
It was just a vehicle regardless of what it was.'

Michael: 'Yeah.
I suppose we could do a classified count er on the A four eight seven sort of a bit away if we wanted a proper classified count couldn't we?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Michael: 'Separate, on another day.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Michael: 'Or we could just use whatever we get at the interview side.
Erm perhaps the thing to do is to look at how it varied in nineteen eighty six.
Did you get that report out?
Yes you did.
How it varied between the two sides.
There's three thousand one hundred there.'

Martine: 'Mhm.'

Michael: 'That's two way.
On a twelve hour day.
So assu you're talking about, well supposing that's grown, it may be four thousand, so you're talking about two thousand tr vehicles in the interview direction over twelve hours.
So you're gonna want to interview forty percent right?
[UNK] How many do you think you'll need?
Do you think you'll need if you have t a team of four on, is that a half team or a six team?'

Martine: 'A half.
A four.
We did have we worked a six team but it's not as easy to work out.'

Michael: 'I'm only thinking that you've got somebody counting?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Michael: 'There's one person counting?'

Martine: 'Two.'

Michael: 'Two people counting.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Michael: 'One's on a break.'

Martine: 'Two.'

Michael: 'Sorry?'

Martine: 'Oh what are you on about now?
When th there's a half team?'

Michael: 'A half team.'

Martine: 'Right yeah.
If there's a half team one people, one person counting one on a break and two interviewing.
And they have a break every three hours.'

Michael: 'Can one person count and cope with that sort of flow?'

Martine: 'No I'd want two people.'

Michael: 'Two people counting?'

Martine: 'Oh what are you on about now?
On this this quieter roa oh right.
Er yeah one person would be alright.'

Michael: 'That's the same sort of flow as we had a Birkdale Cop.'

Martine: 'Mm.'

Michael: 'Isn't it?'

Martine: 'We only had half a team there.'

Michael: 'Right.
Yep that's alright then.
Well my feeling on the roundabout is that we need to do, count ins and outs and do a sample.'

Martine: 'Okay.'

Michael: 'And erm I think that's the thing to do.'

Martine: 'Yeah.
See the, so say if we, like you just said, we need thirteen people'

Michael: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'but there's only gonna be two days.
If we've got two roundabouts there's only gonna be two days when we need that thirteen people.
So when we're'

Michael: 'Two roundabouts?'

Martine: 'There's that other roundabout isn't there?
You know where the horses were in the field?
That was a four armed roundabout.'

Martine: 'Just down from'

Michael: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'the station house place where we parked [UNK]'

Michael: 'You'll find that erm the flows there are very low.'

Martine: 'So you think we could get away with treating that as a crossroads and have people'

Michael: 'I reckon'

Martine: 'doing that?'

Michael: 'I reckon'

Martine: 'Well we could have a person counting and not only are they counting what's coming out of their junction, but they could do left, straight on or right.
Treat it as a crossroads perhaps.'

Michael: 'I reckon si yes four or six people would cover that, no problem.
I think you'll find the flow is a a low'

Martine: '[UNK] it wasn't busy when we were there was it?'

Michael: 'No I mean it may be, you know you i it may be reasonably busy straight through but I would have thought even there you're probably talking about four not a lot higher than that I wouldn't have thought.'

Martine: 'No.
Okay I'll take four people [UNK]'

Michael: 'And erm we're going very round very slow.'

Martine: 'And the visibility was good and everything.'

Michael: 'So I'd have thought that erm you could put four or six, four or six people on that.
And actually if we just counted this to through traffic wouldn't be too much'

Michael: 'Hello right.'

## 031103

Martine: 'your pudding?'

Jim: 'What erm have you heard any of it? [UNK] you have.
What did it sound like?'

[UNK]: 'Mhm.'

Martine: 'or a write off car and joining them and welding them'

Jim: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'down the middle.
Cos that's what happened to Brian, you know when Brian had his Orion nicked? [UNK] got stopped in'

[UNK]: '[UNK] the cars or something?'

Martine: 'Little Sutton [UNK] cars.
And then, it's taking him ages to get [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Has he got it now though?'

Martine: 'Yeah.
But er the things that they were doing were just unbelievable.
Erm you know to get the chassis numbers and that.
[UNK] buying old say a scrapped a written off Sierra you know, picking them up cheap for about a thousand quid from the scrappy'

Jim: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'and then getting all the the chassis numbers and that and welding them on to these stolen cars and [UNK] Because what, you know, er Siobhan's dad had a, bought a Montego and I don't know how it came about but they discovered that erm it had a diff I mean it's had a Maestro engine in it and it had [UNK] this that and the other.
And er they had to repossess it and he was paying [UNK].
And I don't know how, what's happened about it now but at the time he was still having to pay for it'

Jim: 'Mhm.'

Martine: 'even though they'd taken the car.
[UNK] there was a woman there that erm the police do this service thing where they'll look a car over for you, if you bought a car that you know has been er in an accident and it's been'

Jim: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'they will have a look at it over and check it over.
And there was a woman on it, she had a really nice Orion, a J reg.
Anyway when they had a good look at it the front half was an Escort and the back half was an Orion, half a stolen car.
You know they hadn't even matched the same bloody type of car.'

[UNK]: 'There's not really a lot of difference though is there between'

Jim: 'There is [UNK]'

Martine: 'Well there isn't and I I said to Mike what did it look like, you know?
He said it was nice.
But when they're doing these welding jobs they haven't got them on those things so as they're doing it like it's all moving and'

Jim: 'Yeah.
Yeah they're totally'

Martine: 'it was just a complete bodge.'

Jim: 'I if you're driving along you can throw out the balance of the car.'

Martine: 'Yeah.
Well it was that erm one in Manchester, that crash you know there was three people killed in the middle of Manchester wasn't there?'

[UNK]: 'Oh I seem to remember something like that.'

Martine: 'Erm and the car just broke up in half and that was, that had been er welded but like the police are saying as well as soon as they sort of get wise to what they're doing and they find a way to er you know, get on to them, they devised something else.'

Martine: 'And the people doing it in these garages erm, you know like respraying and doing all the welding and everything, really he said some of the things they were doing if they did it legally they'd make a good go of it'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'they were that good at what they were doing.'

[UNK]: 'Tell me was I dreaming or did I see a sketch on T V where there's a car driving round, down the road being chased by the police and the driver said to the passenger er here take this and he says what's that for and he says it's to steer the car, presses a button and the car splits'

Martine: 'It's an advert for Malcolm.'

[UNK]: 'the car s the car split in two.'

Jim: '[UNK] yeah.'

Martine: 'A yellow car.
It's an advert for that film called Malcolm'

[UNK]: 'Is that what it was?'

Martine: 'about the'

Jim: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'retarded lad that invented all these strange and he did bank robberies with a remote control car.
It was an advert, it wasn't [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'But I did see it on the T V?'

Martine: 'Oh you did.'

[UNK]: 'Oh that's fine.'

Martine: 'Straight after er the advert for Del-boy when he says and you know what you can do with that.'

Jim: 'Even talking about trailers now.'

Martine: 'Trainers?'

Jim: 'Talking about te television trailers.'

Martine: 'Oh, oh yeah.'

Jim: 'Not just the programmes.'

Martine: 'There was a programme on about trailers the other night as well.
Have you seen the, the advert for these trainers with no laces, you just tighten the thing up.'

[UNK]: '[UNK] Puma Discus system.
They're out on the twenty [UNK] of March or something.'

Martine: 'Mm.
I wonder how much they're gonna be a pair?'

[UNK]: 'Dunno.
La laces are a thing of the past.
Watch this space or something.'

Martine: 'Yeah.
Something like that.
I thought it was a built in egg timer or something [UNK].'

Jim: 'Obviously another time saving device.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'To save you what say thirty seconds?'

Martine: 'Oh at least.'

Jim: 'Ah there's no point getting cynical is there?'

Martine: 'Not at this time of the day, no.'

Jim: 'Not on a Monday.
Rest of the week.'

Martine: 'Exactly.
Where did he go?'

Jim: 'I thought you were going out?'

[UNK]: 'I I'm finishing early but I'm not go going out.'

Martine: 'Watch you don't er swallow that the wrong way.'

[UNK]: 'I didn't even have anything in me mouth.
Sharp intake of breath.'

[UNK]: 'Excuse me?'

Martine: 'For their telephone number I've just put a question mark and I've put a note here to say I was internally transferred.'

Martine: 'S sounds like I've had an operation doesn't it?
I'm being internally transferred.'

[UNK]: 'Oh.
Someone pressed the I C M button.'

Martine: 'Yeah.
Oh [UNK] I told you didn't I that er the fellow with the Portakabins that does work for the B B C, he had the Portakabin and then your tables are two pound each, and your chairs range from fifty pence to one pound fifty.
I think the ones that are fifty pence are those blue and white striped ones off the prom at Prestatyn'

Martine: '[UNK] job lot.'

Martine: 'And er he didn't say how much the toilet was but that'll probably be separate.
You know, it's a separate thing so there must be a separate price, it would cost a bloody fortune.
And the visibility didn't seem very good out of them.
But the smallest one, the twelve foot ones, there's only one window.
The door's in the back end.
Erm so I presume that was the opposite end to where the tow bar [UNK] would be'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'and then just one window in it.
Maybe just down the length of one side.'

[UNK]: 'Or even just at the end.'

Martine: 'Yeah.
No I think it was down the side I think he said.
But I I think that'll be too expensive anyway.'

[UNK]: 'Mhm.'

Martine: 'And that's why Mr [UNK] said he he'd er'

[UNK]: 'He'd do it, yeah.'

Martine: 'And we know where we are then with the toilet.
You know, you know what you're getting don't you?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'How much [UNK]?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah it'd be erm Jim [UNK] said there would be no problem because his men have to empty their own chemical loos anyway.
But the bowl coupling could be a problem.
He said but we'll sort it out, don't worry love.
They're all very nice [UNK] people.
They have got an accent this [UNK]'s got one but he sounds more Lancashire than anything.
And he's nowhere near.
Perhaps he's just moved there.'

Martine: 'Mm.
I'll have to er give her a ring to [UNK] [UNK] and tell them to send me the advert.
Tell them to buy [UNK].'

[UNK]: 'Mhm.'

Jim: 'When does it go out?'

Martine: 'I don't know.
Today.'

[UNK]: 'Is it going in The Post?'

Martine: 'No.
Didn't we tell you that?
To have it in er Daily Post, The Post is the morning one The Echo's the evening to have it in for one day in The Post and The Echo, how much?'

[UNK]: 'Dunno, about eighty quid.'

Martine: 'Three hundred and ninety six pound sixty four pence.'

[UNK]: 'So you said we'll have it in all week?'

Jim: 'How big was the advert?'

Martine: 'Er about a hundred words in a box.
Two columns wide and erm eight centimetres down.
We reckoned that was about quarter of a page.'

[UNK]: 'It's a lot of money isn't it?'

Martine: 'But see the reason I have to send this to Liverpool for them to put it in'

[UNK]: 'Mhm.'

Martine: 'cos it has to go through our advertising agents.
Cos we advertise in a special format don't we?
We have the dash lines round the box'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'and we have the logo on the bottom and that.
So they've had to do it so I mean she quoted me'

Martine: 'thirty six quid for this thirty six eighty four or something for the local paper.
But erm you know it might be more but that's'

[UNK]: 'Mhm.'

Martine: 'nothing to do with me.
But I mean like I didn't think it was worth putting it in The Post to start off with anyway.
But if we don't get a good response to this I might stick it in for the day in The Post.'

[UNK]: 'Mhm.
Is the secretary at [UNK] dealing with it or is she gonna forward it all on to you?'

Martine: 'No I've put our address.
I said that I didn't like that idea to start off with'

[UNK]: 'No well it'

Martine: 'because although it's only a small concern she's gonna have her own stuff to do.'

[UNK]: 'It's not just that it's the delay in it getting to you anyway.'

Martine: 'Yeah and plus the fact I said to Mike it's all very well saying send stuff there, she can open it she'd be no wiser whether they sound any good or not.'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'So I said no I said, well I've put the phone number as well and I said it might as well, stuff might as well come straight here.'

[UNK]: 'Mhm.'

Martine: 'So I'll give her a ring later in the week or something and I'll see if they'll send me the send me the [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Mhm.'

Martine: 'Policing do you the drop the E, or do you leave the E in?'

[UNK]: 'In.
Policing.'

Martine: 'Erm I'd have thought you dropped it.
What shall I say cos it's it's not a very'

[UNK]: 'Sergeant [UNK] said he would be happy to help with the policing Oh [UNK]'

Martine: 'If you drop the E it looks like policing doesn't it?'

[UNK]: '[UNK] put it in.'

Martine: '[UNK] yeah, I think maybe you keep it in.
It's not a very nice word is it?'

Martine: 'Well I'm just coming to ask you that'

Martine: 'Staffing.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'Double F.'

Michael: 'Have you got the twenty five hundred plans?'

Martine: 'I haven't got any just at the moment.'

Martine: 'Er Sergeant [UNK] will be'

Michael: 'Beg your pardon?'

Martine: 'Sergeant [UNK]'

Michael: 'Oh yes?'

Martine: 'erm very pleased to help us.
As soon as we've got the layouts he'd like to meet us and go out to site [UNK].
He seems very keen to help us do this.'

Michael: 'Right what about the er recruiting and the police cover?'

Martine: 'He's [UNK]'

Michael: 'So do we need to write'

Martine: 'He said on the blower [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'I've started it.
Yeah it's about two hundred and twenty four pages.'

[UNK]: 'Is that all?'

Michael: 'Yeah [UNK]'

Martine: 'Well he is.
He says he will do it himself.
And I said they will require cover for their breaks [UNK] he fell down on that one, he doesn't think [UNK] those two days.
He said oh yes, yes they could have a sandwich [UNK].
He seems very [UNK]'

Michael: 'Good.
Excellent.
Right.'

Martine: 'Mm that doesn't [UNK]'

[UNK]: '[UNK] They're in the same'

Martine: '[UNK] any records of, we had this discussion [UNK] I have er any rec any, every telephone call I make [UNK].'

[UNK]: 'Right [UNK]'

Martine: 'But that's because'

Martine: 'Well that's right [UNK].
I mean it's a case, and then you end up saying yes and you don't need to record every telephone call [UNK]'

[UNK]: '[UNK] They're in the same drawer as the memos.
They're in the bottom [UNK]'

Martine: 'Well I mean she could [UNK]'

Martine: 'Yeah and the alternative [UNK] you know Mi Mike's made calls in the past [UNK].
That's always been very important and that should be [UNK] the letter so that should be on [UNK] on the, on the [UNK]'

## 031104

Will: '[UNK] must be a good microphone stand surely?'

Martine: 'Brilliant'

Will: 'The purpose of the meeting is only to record conversations.'

Martine: 'Right.
Let's see where we're going.'

Martine: 'Okay, just to put you in the picture where'

Will: 'No it's alright.
Go on.
Yes.'

Martine: 'I've had several telephone calls well I've made them as well.
The advert has gone in.
I've done all enquiries about putting the advert in for the temps.'

Will: 'Yes.'

Martine: 'It went to Liverpool on Friday and they were gonna do their best to get it done and'

Will: 'Do we know when it goes in the er'

Martine: 'I think I told Liverpool that if it gets to erm Caernarvon to the Caernarvon office by today it will appear in this week's issue.'

Will: 'Do we know when that comes out?'

Martine: 'No, I couldn't get that off her.'

Will: 'Off who?'

Martine: 'Well I asked the girl and the she, we sort of sidetracked and when I come off the phone I realized that she hadn't said.
I think it's'

Will: 'What I'm thinking of is that'

Martine: 'Thursday or something like that.'

Will: 'Presumably after that we w or on that date we'll start to get phone calls?'

Martine: 'This is true.'

Will: 'And we need to be prepared'

Martine: 'Yep.'

Will: 'because obviously er I mean if you're in'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Will: 'they can be rung through to you but p erm [UNK] will need to be warned that we may get a flood of phone calls'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Will: 'and what they're about.
And also I think it might be as well to have a pro forma.
Probably you've got one.'

Martine: 'Yeah, well no we haven't so we could probably do with doing'

Will: 'Oh'

Martine: 'that and then, you know like if I get inundated I can let Jim do some.'

Jim: 'Well that's right.
I mean really it, it's erm er we, we have a form don't we we, we use when people are interviewed for something or other?
Well if we put their name and address and phone number on it, I mean it's probably just as well to use a standard thing that you can xerox.'

Martine: 'Yeah.
Maybe Jim and I could'

Jim: 'And when they ring up'

Martine: 'do that this avo'

Jim: 'Yeah.
When they ring up we can just say oh yes, what's your [UNK]?
Now look this is meant to record'

Jim: 'this, this, this is meant to record'

Jim: 'life as it is lived, English as she is spoken.
You're not meant to bite your tongue like that.'

Martine: 'Right.
Yeah if we'

Jim: 'You can swear in the privacy of your own home.'

Martine: 'It was your company that I didn't want to swear in front of'

Martine: 'not the tape actually'

Jim: '[UNK] yes alright [UNK]'

Martine: 'No if we er do something so as they have a checklist and we can all, you know like me and Jim say, have a copy to say oh right, can we take your name and address, telephone number'

Martine: 'And if you've got a pad of them or or, or some by you you can just fill it in and let it go through.'

Martine: 'Yeah that'd be a good idea'

Jim: 'Write the name and address and phone number down and then'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'it's there.'

Martine: 'Okay I'll buy that.'

Jim: 'Cos you you'll almost certainly need to ring them back.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'Even if it's to say erm'

Martine: 'Oh sorry!'

Jim: 'sorry we've got enough.'

Martine: 'Yeah okay.
Erm and that also makes sure, if you've got it all in front of you, erm that ensures that you're getting all the information that you need rather than thinking oh hang on, what else do I need sort of thing.'

Jim: 'Right, so that's the temporary staff.'

Martine: 'Yep.'

Jim: 'So what we haven't made any progress on beyond, on that side of things is erm if we do the coding over in Caernarvon, where that will be.'

Martine: 'Yeah.
Erm like I think we all sort of ruled out er [UNK]'

Jim: 'I don't think it's big enough is it?'

Martine: 'Because of the size, no.
Er just out of interest I did ring [UNK] the other day'

Jim: 'Yeah right.'

Martine: 'Er the the room, the smallest room they have is for twenty five to thirty people'

Jim: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'which I mean even that may be too big for what we want.
Erm in any case that is in use every week on a Monday and a Wednesday.
So already you're only talking'

Jim: 'There was a thing about exams.
Wasn't it didn't you ring them up and they said we have exams on or something?'

Martine: 'No.'

Will: 'That must be something [UNK]'

Martine: 'Something goes on in that room on a Monday and a Wednesday.'

Jim: 'Which room is that?'

Martine: 'That's the, I've got it in the file, a small conference room or something like that, or the committee room or something it's called.'

Jim: 'Cos there is a room called the navigation room.'

Martine: 'No that wasn't an that wasn't an option.
There was this one for twenty five to thirty people and then there was another one for say forty or fifty and then it zoomed up to like a hundred.
And even if we were to use this'

Jim: 'Oh I know now, yes.'

Martine: 'small room, you couldn't leave anything on the walls so it would all be a come down at night, back up in the morning'

Jim: 'What erm er did you look in the file and see what they hired last time?'

Martine: 'Erm no.'

Jim: 'Cos it may'

Martine: 'I mean I've probably seen it'

Jim: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'but I can't remember.'

Jim: 'Cos probably it will say what room it was.'

Martine: 'Yeah it was this small, I'

Jim: 'It may well have been ano'

Martine: 'think it was this I thought it was the small'

Jim: 'Oh it was that one was it?'

Martine: 'Well you're talking now'

Jim: 'Anyway'

Martine: 'Do you want me to get it?'

Jim: 'Er have you got it on your desk?'

Martine: 'Yes.'

Jim: 'Oh [UNK] right [UNK]'

Will: 'How many days are we talking about anyway? [UNK] coding [UNK] data.'

Jim: 'Couple of weeks I suppose.'

Will: 'Right.'

Jim: 'No wait a minute, three sites you're talking about a week and a half or something aren't we?'

Martine: 'Yeah.
Fortnight at the most.'

Jim: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'Cos you've got to allow for like they might not have done it before.
Erm but you're talking fifty eight pound a day'

Jim: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'for that small room which I think's a bit steep personally.'

Jim: 'Let me take a look.'

Martine: 'It's er'

Jim: 'It's possible that you did get on the the [UNK] [UNK]'

Martine: 'It crossed my mind.'

Jim: 'There's The Oak's room.
Can't [UNK]'

Martine: 'The Oak's room up to a hundred and twenty.'

Jim: 'Four pound per hour.
Sixteen pound a day.
And what are you saying it is now?'

Martine: 'Fifty eight pound a day.'

Jim: 'That's an awful lot more isn't it?'

Martine: 'Yeah.
There's I mean so many of them have caught on.
Jan for example, when we had the the town hall thing, that was five pound a day.'

Jim: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'It's twenty five pound a day now.
I think they've just all jumped on the bandwagon.'

Jim: 'They don't provide anything really do they?'

Martine: 'Well no, that's it.
So as soon as she said that it was in use Monday Wednesday I sort of'

Jim: 'If we went to [UNK]'

Martine: 'subconsciously ruled it out.'

Jim: 'village hall, church hall'

Martine: 'Yeah?'

Jim: 'which is a church hall, they don't have a charge, you have to make a contribution.'

Martine: 'Where's this sorry?'

Jim: 'Well you, you need to, it's pretty grotty, it's a grim place'

Martine: 'Mm.'

Jim: 'but it's er it's the church the parish hall in [UNK].
Whether they've got tables and stuff like that I'm not sure.'

Martine: 'Mm.'

Jim: 'If you ring Roger [UNK]'

Martine: 'Yeah'

Jim: 'and ask him.
He did investigate having a public enquiry there last year.
And erm so he will have a phone number of the vicar and so on.'

Martine: 'Mm okay.
Okay.'

Jim: 'I mean in a w well I can't, did we, I wonder if we recharge this to the Welsh Office or not?
We probably do.
Probably doesn't matter does it?'

Martine: 'No I would have thought'

Jim: 'The other thing might be to ring up [UNK] Borough Council cos they've got offices in Caernarvon.
Suppose that that place [UNK] they might, there might be a er a parish hall there or something [UNK]'

Martine: 'That pub would be alright wouldn't it?'

Will: 'Yeah. [UNK]'

Martine: 'Okay, or'

Jim: 'That would be twenty five pound a day as well, or fifty pound a day as well.
Anyway it's a thought.
I mean if we have to'

Jim: 'er obviously what you're saying with [UNK] it's already in use and we can't have it?'

Martine: 'Yeah.
It's not erm it's no good just saying oh we can have three days out of the week anyway.'

Jim: 'No.'

Martine: 'You know, it's gotta be Monday to Friday or none at all hasn't it?'

Jim: 'Mm.
Well if it was four days it would be alright but'

Martine: 'Mm.'

Jim: 'anyway'

Martine: 'Okay so they're a few options to try as regards the coding'

Jim: 'Alright and if we can't find anyway where we'll have to [UNK] out and come back here.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: '[UNK] problem as well.'

Martine: 'I think we, we should find somewhere.'

Jim: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'Really.
Erm so that's a few options as regards the coding.
Now'

Jim: 'Right [UNK]'

Martine: 'The interviewing and the briefing session I think we'll probably get away with in Debbie [UNK] 's'

Jim: 'Yeah we're not going to, I mean we're only going to we're, we're'

Martine: 'Well it's not a sort of formal interview [UNK]'

Jim: 'we'll only be briefing the interview staff'

Martine: 'That's right.'

Jim: 'and accounts staff.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'So we're only talking about half a dozen [UNK]'

Martine: 'Well I think it's slightly more.'

Jim: 'Well eight or ten or something isn't it?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'Thanks.'

Martine: 'Thanks [UNK].
Yeah you're talking about a dozen people, something like that aren't you?
I mean for that er'

Jim: 'Well if necessary we can bring them into here.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'Half a dozen and half a dozen [UNK]'

Martine: 'Yeah.
That's, I can't see that being a problem, that should be okay [UNK].'

Will: 'Have you briefed [UNK] before?'

Martine: 'Yeah.
Well Mike comes out.
Mike shows his face doesn't he?'

Martine: 'Well he did for the Wigan one.'

Jim: 'I did it for the erm Ormskirk one [UNK]'

Martine: 'Yeah.
That was okay wasn't it?'

Jim: 'We did that in two shifts didn't we?
Two days.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'Two mornings.'

Martine: 'We had a hell of a lot of staff though didn't we?
That was a, we did that in the conference room downstairs.'

Will: 'Mm.'

Jim: 'Erm right.
What w w'

Martine: 'And anyway'

Jim: 'we now, we've, we've also got to progress on site layout and things haven't we?'

Martine: 'Yes.'

Jim: 'And get in er the cones and signs.'

Martine: 'Yeah I've had er [UNK]'

Jim: '[UNK] we, we, you've got [UNK] we've got to wait till tomorrow haven't we?'

Martine: 'That's right, yeah.'

Will: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'Now as regards signs I've spoke to numerous, oh school holidays I've got erm [UNK]'

Martine: 'when the schools are off.'

Jim: 'Right.'

Martine: 'I spoke to the Education Department on Friday.
Erm as regards a caravan I spoke to this bloke Frank'

Martine: 'No he's gone bust.
Well he hasn't gone bust but they don't hire them any more'

Jim: 'Oh right.'

Martine: 'but I did try him.
Er no Gwyllam [UNK] at Gwyneth County Council'

Jim: 'Gwyllam [UNK] oh no I'm thinking of Peter [UNK].'

Martine: 'erm he didn't think they had any bilingual signs and they didn't have they weren't using their Portakabins so they scrapped them all last year sold them off.'

Jim: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'But he did give me somebody to ring about caravans'

Jim: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'but then later on in the day he rung back and said he had found some bilingual signs but all he's got were about four foot square er with census point ahead.
He hasn't got things like stop census.
Stop if required or slow census point which is the ones we use.'

Jim: 'It might be worth asking erm Mel [UNK]'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'about that.
You see for a start we need to decide to we need it.
Do we need them'

Martine: 'Bilingual?'

Jim: 'bilingual?
They can't have been bilingual last time because they were hired from Staffordshire County Council.'

Martine: 'No.
And the other thing er if they they just haven't got anything like that.'

Jim: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'They use sort of blank'

Will: 'Wasn't there a big fuss though because there wasn't enough effort made on the bilingual side the last survey we did?'

Jim: 'I don't think so was there?'

Martine: 'There's a letter in the file'

Will: 'Well that's [UNK]'

Martine: 'about erm why we didn't use bilingual staff for one of the particular dates.
Erm it come from the county surveyor, apparently he'd had complaints.
But I mean it was purely a re a recruiting problem.
Er you know erm the letter, the reply went back from Dave [UNK] saying that every you know, possible thing was done to get bilingual staff but at the end of the day you know they couldn't come up with the goods.
I mean the lengths they went to advertising, I hope we're gonna have more luck now.
They had temping agencies, job centres, local papers the job centre only came up with about two people.
So I'm touching wood that we're gonna be in a different situation.'

Jim: 'I wonder if, I wonder if erm you know if you rang up erm the county council and said you know I mean er y just make use of a contact and say look, we wanna do this survey, you know, do you happen to know a any members of your family'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'You know?
It maybe'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'You can very often er for instance at Cheshire very often I mean there were sort of some people's wives would like to do it.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'It may be, you know?'

Martine: 'Yeah.
See how the response goes with this and then'

Jim: 'Who is it you've spoken to at Gwyneth?'

Martine: 'Er Gwyllam [UNK].'

Jim: 'And where is he?
Who, how did you get hold of him?'

Martine: 'Erm [UNK]'

Jim: 'You rang up, did you ring up Owen [UNK]?'

Martine: 'Er no.
I spoke I just rung up erm it was Highways and Transportation and'

Jim: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'I asked to speak to somebody in the Highways in the Transportation'

Jim: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'This was at Bangor and then I got another number and then I got told that they now have the direct [UNK] organisation'

Jim: 'Right.'

Martine: 'so then I rung this person here and spoke to a Steven [UNK]'

Jim: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'who was the head from the civi civil engineering division.'

Jim: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'Steven [UNK] put me through to this Gwyllam [UNK]'

Jim: 'Right.'

Martine: 'who is in the, the depot place.'

Jim: 'Right.'

Martine: 'And that's how I got on to him.'

Jim: 'Okay.
So we've not spoken to anybody on the sort of like the traffic erm counting side of things there?'

Martine: 'No.
No.'

Jim: 'Okay.'

Martine: 'So this fella was, he come up, he found these signs and said, you know, didn't know if they would be, be any good.
Erm but he'd given me this number, Glen [UNK] about Portakabins.
Er he's at [UNK].
And I rung this Glen [UNK] er wherever that is erm and he does have these Portakabin things.
Er several measurements'

Jim: 'Is that, that's a hire company is it?'

Martine: 'Yeah, they're like they've got a big fleet of them.
Erm'

Jim: 'Right.
But they're Portakabins?'

Martine: 'Yeah, rather than caravans.'

Jim: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'Now I don't think they sound very [UNK] to suit our needs.'

Jim: 'Well you have to furnish them as well don't you?'

Martine: 'Well that's it.
And there's all separate, two pound a table from fifty pence to one pound fifty for a chair.
There's no toilet in them'

Jim: 'And you probably have to hire them by the week do you?'

Martine: 'Er minimum of four weeks.'

Jim: 'Yeah.
And how do you move them around?'

Martine: 'Well they would move them round this fella himself, but it's gonna be a hell of a lot of money to get them to do that.'

Jim: 'Mm that's what I would have thought.'

Martine: 'Plus there's no toilet.'

Jim: 'Exactly.'

Martine: 'But he has a separate toilet.
Well that's all gonna be extra as well.'

Jim: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'And erm'

Jim: 'So how much you talking about?
For a twelve foot one'

Martine: 'Well you're talking'

Jim: 'twenty two pounds?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'So you're talking about eighty eight quid?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'It would be cheaper to get David [UNK].'

Martine: 'Yeah well I've spoke to David [UNK].
He's quite willing to take the caravan out there.
Erm and then you've got the toilet on there.
You know what you're getting because we've had it before.
So then I got back on to Gwyllam [UNK] and said that if we provided our own caravan, would you someone there be willing to do the from site to site and he said that wouldn't be a problem.'

Jim: 'Right.'

Martine: 'But he doesn't know any details.'

Jim: 'Okay.'

Martine: 'Er you know I mean just like we don't.
We don't know dates or anything yet do we?'

Jim: 'No.'

Martine: 'So I think we've developed in that direction that I can go ahead as soon as I've got some dates and book it properly with Mr [UNK].'

Jim: 'I think that's probably the best.'

Martine: 'And just let these do the transporting because this this fella honest to god he was doing me head in.
Erm saying oh one left, we've got a contract with the B B C you know, isn't it.'

Martine: 'Oh and if he said it once well he said it half a dozen times trying to impress me.
So let's stick to Mr [UNK].
We know where we are with him.'

Jim: 'Oh right, yes well I'm quite happy with that.'

Will: 'Right.'

Jim: 'Er so the only other thing are the automatic counters then isn't it?'

Will: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'And we, we've got to wait for erm Mel [UNK] to be in tomorrow.
Haven't we?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Will: 'And we're obviously going to ask him to'

Jim: 'He, he'

Will: 'to go ahead with it.'

Jim: 'looks after, I, I'm not sure exactly what he does, but he does sort of look after the Welsh Office's own traffic counting programme.'

Will: 'Mm.'

Jim: 'They have a sort of programme of their own on er doing counts on roads.
I mean a and most of it's done through the county councils.
So we'll have certain sites that are counted and they have the, the equipment.
Er when we last did the work there in nineteen eighty nine he'd, he'd provided Gwyneth with three machines which they moved round and put on different places for us.
And I think they're ones that have a cartridge in.
And the information's recorded on the cartridge.
And they take the cartridge out and they send it down to Cardiff which is where Mel [UNK] is'

Will: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'and he chucks it into, bungs it into his machine and then gets the printout then which he then sends to wherever.'

Will: 'Ah.'

Jim: 'So what we, we need to go to him I think in the first instance and say we want to do X Y and Z, and if he, if he says fine you know.
But if he says I'm sorry, I haven't got the equipment we then have to go outside'

Will: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'obviously but I think you need clearly in the first instance to use that [UNK]'

Martine: 'And you're saying to also mention to me if he's got [UNK]'

Jim: 'Well I, it's just a thought.
I mean if we're gonna be speaking to him we may as well ask whether'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'just to say that we, you know, that we'll, we, we're going, we're proposing to do some origin destination surveys interviewing, and we'll need the signing to go with it that Gwyneth don't appear to have them and, and in consequence we're proposing to hire them elsewhere.
Erm and erm you know, we know that last time it was done er the, the signs were not bilingual, the ones [UNK] census point and so on'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'and that erm is he w er would, did he think that would be a problem.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'Cos I think last time we hired them from Staffordshire and I'd have thought if they're going to buy some they will be very happy to hire us them.
Cos presumably, when you look at the layout most of the signs are keep left signs.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'Or you get the you get ones that are sort of road narrows'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'and you get the, the warning ones.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'And the warning ones have a little census plate on.
Erm so presumably you perhaps need to do something about that.
But the keep left ones they're gonna have in stock aren't they?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'So the only ones you really need and, and the, and the road narrows and the warning ones, they're all gonna be in stock.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'So the only ones that probably need to get made are census stop if required etcetera.
So there's only three of those.'

Martine: 'Yeah slow census and whatever.'

Jim: 'So presumably if, if Staffordshire have them made and we get those three whizzed up to Caernarvon you know, the rest can sort of fit into place.
Cos if you put survey instead of census at the bottom, I mean I know that's not strictly speaking how it should be, but they must have signs for us to survey because they have their own, presumably they have their own surveyors go out and'

Martine: 'Yeah.
Yeah like'

Jim: 'you know and [UNK]'

Martine: 'you see yellow ones don't you?
On the motorway and stuff'

Jim: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'they have survey on.'

Jim: 'But they very often, that triangular one with an exclamation mark, there'll be a little'

Martine: 'Yeah'

Jim: 'plate on the bottom that says survey.'

Martine: 'yeah.'

Jim: 'Well maybe it's not really right, but, but perhaps that I'd have thought it would be alright.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'Census, it's probably the same in Welsh as well you know, don't you know?'

Martine: 'Yeah, I see what you mean.
We might be able to get round it.
I'll see what this fella says.
Well I mean I was saying to this bloke well can you think of anywhere where we might be able to, oh no no no can't think of anywhere.'

Jim: 'Well you could try Clwyd or something but [UNK] can't think everybody you know.
Clwyd might well do some.
I wonder'

Martine: 'Oh it might be worth giving Nige a ring.'

Jim: 'He's at Cheshire.'

Martine: 'Oh yeah.
Who do we know at Clwyd?'

Jim: 'Davydd [UNK].'

Martine: 'Who?'

Jim: 'Davydd [UNK].'

Martine: 'Never heard of him.
He's Brian's brother is he?'

Jim: '[UNK] no.'

Martine: 'Okay so let's just go [UNK]'

Jim: 'He used to work for Liverpool City I think, and he was called Dave there.'

Martine: 'Er right, just going back to the actual er roadside interview, is that one on the the B road, or is it the A?'

Martine: 'That's the one.
Er I was only going to propose to use four staff on that.'

Jim: 'Have a look at the, I think that's what we've done last time.
Yeah.'

Martine: 'Okay.'

Jim: 'Have a look at the erm we must have a count but yes, have you got that report?'

Will: 'Of the'

Jim: 'Or have you given it back to me?'

Jim: 'Well no just the [UNK] oh, yes it might be on that but I the early report [UNK]'

Will: '[UNK] the reports on the erm [UNK] surveys which were done'

Jim: 'Did you give it back?'

Will: 'Yes I did.'

Jim: 'Right.
Okay.'

Martine: 'Okay so then'

Jim: 'Well they give us an idea of what the flow was then anyway won't it?'

Martine: 'Yes.'

Jim: 'And I think you're right.'

Martine: 'And the other thing'

Jim: 'Oh'

Martine: 'oh we've put in a making the interview forms, just having the Welsh translation on the top.
I was explaining to Jim how we could do that and it looked pretty straightforward so or, or not.
It's'

Jim: 'Have we got the interview forms?'

Martine: 'That we used last time?'

Jim: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'Yeah but they're like four interviews on a sheet and really sort of'

Jim: 'Yeah.
But I mean who'

Jim: 'what, how w, what are w, have we got our current ones, our standard ones?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'Cos presumably it would be best to use those wouldn't it?'

Martine: 'Yeah.
I think you could, you could accommodate it if you just reduced that sli the, what the normal one slightly, and there's t there's room to put the er translation on the top.
I'll do you a mock up of that and see what you'

Jim: 'Yes, good idea.'

Martine: 'what you think.'

Jim: 'I think either that or have it on a separate sheet.
But I would have thought it's best to put it on there if we can.
How many are we gonna want?
Three thousand?
Perhaps it's worth having a separate print run for that isn't it?'

Martine: 'Yeah, might be.'

Jim: 'It's not I think if they use this offset thing, the masters last about five hundred so you're not it's not, it's not a silly amount.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'Would it take, oh wait a minute!
Three thousand interviews'

Martine: 'What'

Jim: 'say, would you think three thousand interviews?'

Martine: 'I'm just trying to think what we were averaging.
But I mean that one of them's not gonna you're not gonna get as many on that B road.
Will we will we want those?
Oh I can't remember you know what we used for Ormskirk [UNK]'

Jim: 'It doesn't matter if we if we get too many cos you can always use [UNK]'

Martine: 'Well that's it.'

Jim: 'Can't you?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'Mm.
If you see what I mean.'

Martine: 'Yeah.
Well so you think actually send something through to reprographics for them to do in Liverpool?'

Jim: 'Well you don't want to be doing it on the machine down here do you?'

Martine: 'No.'

Jim: 'And if you got three thousand interviews, say a thousand at, well y you probably wouldn't, you'd probably get'

Martine: 'Probably two of those boxes would do wouldn't it?'

Jim: '[UNK] you could get nearly four thousand interviews couldn't you, altogether?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'At two on a page is two thousand sheets plus however many you'd only get one on.
So I'd have thought three thousand wasn't out of the way really.'

Martine: 'And like you say if there's some left they won't go to waste anyway.'

Jim: 'No.
Oh on the other hand I suppose we could say well we'll use, we'll get some and if we run out we'll use English ones.
If you do it that way, you know, by the time they get there they should know what the questions are shouldn't they?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'Excuse me, by the time you run a'

Martine: 'Cos we hold the original to that.
To the interview'

Jim: 'Well we'll need some [UNK] anyway.'

Martine: 'Yeah.
We've probably, I mean we, we hold the original on an A three [UNK] so it might be worthwhile doing a [UNK] copy of it.
Doctoring it'

Jim: 'Oh I see yeah.'

Martine: 'to insert the Welsh because John will have to send the original off for [UNK]'

Jim: 'Oh right.
Yes [UNK].
We'll have a look'

Martine: 'And then we can have the base copy of each then couldn't we?'

Jim: 'Good.'

Martine: 'I'll, I'll dig it out after.'

Jim: 'Yeah, right.'

Martine: 'Right, is there anything else?
So, yeah there is.
Erm things like whether I'm using my car and stuff I suppose I need to speak to Mike about?'

Jim: 'I haven't done anything about that.'

Martine: 'Right.
Erm'

Martine: 'erm statutory undertakers?
Bus companies'

Jim: 'Yes we'll need to write to all those and we'll need to write we need to write to the police'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'on in two guises don't we?
Partly because we're doing a survey but partly to warn partly because of the emergency services aspect.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'So we need to write to the police to er I suppose the thing to do is we write in a general way to the, the Chief Constable, North Wales police'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'which is I think in Colwyn Bay'

Martine: 'Yeah it is.'

Jim: 'and but when it comes to actually organising the police control of the survey sites, we, we speak to the erm traffic inspector at wherever it is.
I'm not sure [UNK]'

Martine: 'Right so who did you say in Colwyn Bay?
What what [UNK]'

Jim: 'Just write to the Chief Constable.
I think we need to write three letters.
One to the police, one to the ambulance, one to the fire brigade just saying we're proposing to do them.
Obviously that'll have to be when we've fixed the sites'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'and the dates are on.'

Martine: 'Yeah we'll do this'

Jim: 'But that's normal.'

Martine: 'general letter to the police saying that we're intending to do these surveys, just putting them in the picture and put a note in that erm once, you know, dates and whatever, you know, we'll give you further details as and when we know'

Jim: 'Well I wouldn't, I don't think I'd worry about writing to them until we've got the dates.'

Martine: 'Oh okay.'

Jim: 'Oh I suppose we've gotta, oh well what did we do last time?
I remember the problem was last time sending those little plans out, the Ormskirk you know?
Give them the drawing number so we sent a transmittal note, course we never got a transmittal note back.
It's best to avoid that.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'Erm right well I think the thing to do is, on beyond that is to make sure we work through the checklist.
Okay?
Erm Now layouts, site layouts.'

Martine: 'Yeah maps and things.
So are you leaving the ball in my court on that?'

Jim: 'On what?'

Martine: 'On the statutory undertakers.
Cos I can probably get some information out of here.'

Jim: 'I think i if you want er I mean you're quite happy to draft a letter?'

Martine: 'Yeah.
I mean that's a'

Jim: 'I mean again'

Martine: 'standard thing that goes to all of them [UNK]'

Jim: 'we need to write them, warn yeah, and we ask them to let us know what they've got planned don't we?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'So you could send them a letter with a little diagram that'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'I wonder how good that is, yes I think that's alright isn't it?
Then they wouldn't they'd understand what we, that meant wouldn't they?'

Martine: 'Yeah but that's got specific things on [UNK].'

Jim: 'True.'

Martine: 'Yeah well all we did for Ormskirk was, it was just an O S map and we just drew a bloody great circle round it'

Martine: 'and said this is the study area.'

Jim: 'That's probably the best thing isn't it?'

Martine: 'Yeah.
And blow up'

Martine: 'an O S and just well within our sites and everything'

Jim: 'But don't give it a drawing number.'

Martine: 'No.'

Jim: 'It's just attached to the letter.'

Martine: 'Yes.'

Jim: 'Now you get your, you've got your list of who you want to write to?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'If you check with erm Dennis [UNK] because they're doing all, you know, doing the contract documents, he could confirm all the, the current addresses.'

Martine: 'Okay.'

Jim: 'That alright?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'You're sounding a bit weary.'

Martine: 'No that's alright [UNK]'

Jim: 'There's no rush about this, I mean er you know, you've got well'

Martine: 'Well there is up to a point because you know how bad they are at responding.'

Jim: 'Yes there is.
I mean er what I mean is it needs to be done this week sort of thing.'

Martine: 'Yes.
Oh that's okay I'll get all them off [UNK].
I'll do a, I'll do a draft letter this afternoon, you can have a look at it, erm we'll knock a plan up and her get the addresses and then that's it's easy then innit?'

Jim: 'Yeah.
I wonder if we do want to put it in [UNK]'

Martine: 'Oh sshh'

Jim: 'You've finished your mi meeting already Mike?'

Jim: 'Right, well let's, okay.'

[UNK]: 'Er, yes.
Sorry about that.'

Jim: 'No it's alright we're only trying to work somewhere, somewhere quiet.'

## 031105

Martine: 'I suddenly thought that on the advert that's gone in'

Jim: 'Yeah there's a chair here.'

Martine: 'On the advert that's gone in I did wonder whether to put please respond by such and such a date?'

Jim: 'Don't worry about it.'

Martine: 'You don't think it's necessary?'

Jim: 'If they don't respond by the date, you know do it quickly'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'they're not interested.'

Martine: 'Okay.
That's all we did for the statutory undertakers.
Dead simple.
Just drew them a whacking great circle round it and'

Jim: 'Yeah, good.'

Martine: 'Okay?
So something similar [UNK]'

Jim: 'Excellent.
Something like that yes.
Yes.
Erm'

Martine: 'So I'll speak to Dennis for er addresses.'

Will: 'Is there a phone number in the ad or just an address? [UNK]'

Martine: 'A phone number as well yeah.'

Will: 'Oh right.'

Martine: 'I think most people ring.
You know cos it'

Martine: 'wastes so much time.'

Will: 'Your name [UNK]?'

Martine: 'Yeah.
But we'll just have a word with Anna-Lee and if, I think you know, she'll say what's it concerning and if I'm not there well she can put them through to you.'

Jim: 'Okay.'

Martine: 'Erm so you say, are we saying that we're gonna leave the police till we've got some dates?
And the'

Jim: 'Well we know when we're gonna do it don't we?'

Martine: 'Do we?'

Jim: 'Well we know it's the last week in April or something'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'don't we?'

Martine: 'Well we wanna know whether we were gonna try and do them all in that week?
Twenty seventh of April.
Monday Tuesday Thursday.'

Jim: 'I think the plan that goes to to the police thank you needs to show the i interview sites on it.
You remember we had, on the Ormskirk one we did one that had a study area on it?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'But we also had one that showed the individual locations.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'And I think that was the one that went to the police.'

Martine: 'Right.'

Jim: 'Er and the fire brigade and, and so on.'

Will: 'Yeah cos they'll want to know.'

Martine: 'Well that's it.'

Will: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'And all you're doing is warning them that they will, the things will be there and we'll make sure that if a emergency vehicle comes along erm'

Will: 'But they will know your precise dates won't they?
Well they'll want to know precise dates.'

Jim: 'I can't remember that we did actually.'

Martine: 'No I don't know whether we do give them, even [UNK] the precise dates.'

Will: 'It isn't really much use then is it, just giving them a rough?'

Jim: 'Well it's only a warning.
Well we'll have a look back in, I'll have a look back in the file and see what we did last time.
Erm Do you wanna do that, have a look at what we'd said in Ormskirk'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'on that side of things?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'I think I wrote to them if I remember rightly.'

Martine: 'Well I didn't.'

Jim: 'Erm now we need to do something about layout plans.
So we need to get some if we're going to work on ordnance survey ones we'll need to sort something on that.
Have to have a chat with [UNK] Anyway you're not in an immediate rush to do that are you?'

Martine: 'No.'

Jim: 'The, the yeah.
What have you told only you haven't told Gwyllam [UNK] anything have you?
Cos you, what you've told him is did you talk about chapter eight?'

Martine: 'No.'

Martine: 'No.
I, I just said to him, when he said we've got these census point ahead I said well we've got certain restrictions, you know, we've certain rules and regulations we've gotta comply with I mean I didn't reel off any of this blah.
But I said oh, are you familiar with setting up roadside interviews and for this type of thing?
Oh yes, we've got such and such a fella out there that does nothing but that out all day long.
And yet they didn't have any signs so I think he's talking through his hat.
But what he probably means is that they set up signs for'

Jim: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'you know, roadworks and stuff.'

Jim: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

Martine: 'So I mean I would have thought they've gotta comply with the same'

Jim: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'the same sort of things.'

Jim: 'I think the thing is, actually, just thinking about it, there will be a Welsh version of this if there is one if you see what I mean?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'If there isn't one then we, we er er it er oh mind you I suppose there's no hassle to them to put a Welsh thingy, anyway I'll look at that.
Right, now the other thing is that what Jim's doing which is that programme, how is that coming along?'

Jim: 'Yeah.
What I did was I got I went down to the print room and I got a piece of A one paper and I mean if you want to use Chris'

Jim: 'Chris [UNK] over in Chester office, see if, that one would, oh mind you there isn't a chair there is there?
Mind you is Jonathan away?'

Martine: 'There's this chair here.
Jonathan's not here.'

Jim: 'Is Jonathan away?'

[UNK]: 'Yes, two day a day and a half or something, two days?'

Jim: 'Right.
So, you know, there's desks around anyway'

Will: 'Mm'

Jim: 'that you could use'

Will: 'Okay.'

Jim: 'and erm er that's what I used if you want to borrow that you can.'

Will: 'Thanks.'

Jim: 'And do it in pencil and just, and then we can rub it out'

Will: '[UNK] yes.'

Jim: 'and change things and so on, yeah.
Well it's easy to change isn't it?
Because presumably Peter will need to incorporate that in an overall programme.
When we look at the highway side.'

Will: 'So it's just the traffic side which I'm dealing with here?'

Jim: 'Yes.
Cos that's all I'm dealing with.
Okay and perhaps erm perhaps you'd also like to l would you like to look at this side of things as well?'

Will: 'Incorporate that into it?'

Martine: 'No, the, the layout plans, do, do some layout plans.'

Will: 'Oh yeah sure.'

Jim: 'Marty's done them before you see haven't you?'

Martine: 'Yep.'

Jim: 'So I'm, I'm just trying to look at the ones for [UNK] and then we'll go from there.
Okay, is that alright?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'Now, have I given either of you task schedules for this'

Martine: 'No.'

Jim: 'stuff?
So I need to do that don't I?
Er in fact I never gave [UNK] telephone call [UNK] it's no good telling me to do something [UNK]'

Jim: 'Task schedules, [UNK] ooh [UNK] I'll have to get the form.
Okay, so you want a task schedule for doing doing the traffic report?'

Martine: 'Mhm.'

Jim: 'Mm yeah?'

Will: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'And also for doing the programme.
Yeah?
And you want a task schedule for organizing this, it's a bit unspecific isn't it?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'Okay.
Erm how is that then?
Er you happy to leave things as they are for the minute?
Carry on on that basis?'

Martine: 'Yeah, the only other thing like when you were saying about site layouts, if there's any maps that we need, and that's including maps for coding, wall maps, you know, large scale.'

Jim: 'Well obviously we've got to progress into that.
We need to prepare some zone plans and gazetteers maybe.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'Erm oh well I'll er the other thing I was thinking of is that er we could be looking er towards beginning, you know even now, to doing a trips network and things like that.
There's no real reason why you, say, shouldn't start to build up the data on that.'

Will: 'Yeah.'

Jim: 'Erm y y you know you, you could do a diagram and presumably the person to speak to would be Billy or maybe Peter cos I think Peter did the bulk of the work.'

Will: 'Okay.'

Jim: 'Beverley did a lot of the actual sort of dogsbody work, you know, the actual doing of it.
Erm so you need to build up a picture of what you've got erm but there's no real reason why we shouldn't be working on that now it seems to me.
Er in principle.'

Jim: 'Yes beginning, you know, we, we know what we're trying to do obviously we don't necessarily know every, every node in the network erm Cos obviously once you start doing that, or when we start doing tr the, the journey run things erm we're going to need to know what we're wanting.
So there'll be two sides of it c er'

Will: 'Well there, there won't be any [UNK] will there?
Erm'

Jim: 'Mm.
But anyway I mean it's all part of the picture.
What I'm getting at is there's no reason why we need, we should wait until after the surveys to start looking at trips.
Which is what happened on Ormskirk.
Mind you it was partly because we didn't get a programme.
But there's no reason, and on [UNK] as well.
Alright?'

Martine: 'Right, so me and Jim had a chat the other day just looking at the the roadside entries and the counts and I was sort of saying if we work on the basis that we want between ten and twelve people, twelve people maximum'

Jim: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'erm I think we're be able to do all the counts with that number of people including the St David's roundabout and'

Jim: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'but we do need to clarify exactly what you want on that.
Whether you want samples doing cos that's gonna take more people, or whether you're just doing ins and outs and stuff like that.'

Jim: 'Well'

Martine: 'And on the other roundabout for that matter.'

Jim: 'Are you off?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah I've got a [UNK] seminar in Manchester [UNK].'

Jim: 'Oh right.
How did it go?'

[UNK]: 'Fine.
Probably find that [UNK] traffic [UNK] percent [UNK]'

Jim: '[UNK] we're just talking now this, this is, this is one we're discussing.'

[UNK]: 'Oh well just south of Caernarvon on the first section erm between Caernarvon and [UNK]?'

[UNK]: 'Yes.'

Jim: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'Gwyneth haven't really started on doing any of that work yet.
[UNK] work.
And they need to do traffic.
And also they need to confirm the traffic erm turning [UNK] 099 junction at er I can never pronounce it, beginning with an L.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah [UNK].
And er maybe count, maybe [UNK] do their traffic counts out of that as well.
So the guy that was in charge of those schemes with Gwyneth'

Jim: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'was at the meeting or came into the meeting to explain about the schemes.'

Jim: 'What's his name?'

[UNK]: 'Erm'

Jim: 'Peter will know.'

[UNK]: 'Peter's got his name down.'

Jim: 'Cos that was one of the things we talked about [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Vernon somebody or other I think his name was.
Vernon'

Jim: '[UNK] need to contact them.'

[UNK]: 'Yes, need to do that this week.

Jim: 'Do Welsh Office want any more'

[UNK]: 'bits'

Jim: 'copies of that?'

Jim: 'So that's fine, good.'

[UNK]: 'erm and they should comment this week about what extra bits they think they could perhaps cover.
So maybe [UNK] a few more turning counts [UNK] the census [UNK]'

Martine: 'Mm.'

Jim: 'Right.
And that wasn't where I well I haven't been'

Jim: 'particularly looking for work from that particular [UNK]'

[UNK]: '[UNK] to know is they raised er the question about the er counts we're doing for the Caernarvon link'

Jim: 'Yes.'

[UNK]: 'which is part of this study.'

Jim: 'Yes.'

[UNK]: 'They want us to divorce the staff time'

Jim: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'and charge it against the Caernarvon job.'

Jim: 'Right.
The Caernarvon link job?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah which is to our benefit cos we get [UNK]'

Jim: 'Mm.
What about the work for Gwyneth?'

[UNK]: 'If that's extra'

Jim: 'What do we charge that to?'

[UNK]: 'That is [UNK] bypass.'

Jim: 'They don't want us to charge it to extra to works?
We could have a two point six seven multiplier'

[UNK]: 'No.
Er er er as far as they're concerned any extra work is just an enhancement of the rate to the bypass erm rate, point six two percent.
That was what [UNK] pointed out.'

Jim: 'He pointed out?
Any'

[UNK]: '[UNK] said we need approval for extra work'

Jim: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'he said well it's just, it's time costs, it's just an extension of the [UNK]'

Jim: 'Are they wanting a budget figure from us?'

[UNK]: 'We're gonna have to put'

Martine: 'What was Paul saying about the wedding then?'

Mike: 'Only said who he invited.
I said, I said have you invited Aunty Joan and them?
He said oh I've invited Aunty Joan but nobody else cos I didn't fancy any of the others.'

Martine: 'And has he invited Joan to the day do and that?'

Mike: 'Yeah.
But he hasn't invited any [UNK] to the night [UNK].
I think I might have [UNK] his conscience by saying that I don't mind.'

Martine: 'Well for what they see [UNK] I can understand him asking Joan and Graham erm maybe they've gotta watch how much they're'

Mike: 'I know but an extra four people's not gonna cost that much more is it?'

Martine: 'Shut up.'

Mike: 'You little sod.'

Martine: 'The cat?'

Mike: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'Oh I'm shattered.'

Mike: 'Why I asked him is because he had a wedding invitation for Rob and Jen [UNK]'

Martine: 'Yeah.
Well to be honest I can understand why he's not asking them.
You know they'll make up with friends you know, what family they're not asking won't they?'

Mike: 'Oh aye.'

Martine: 'No it's not as if you're all close is it?'

Mike: 'No.'

Martine: 'And I mean we haven't seen them since ours hardly have we?'

Mike: 'No'

Martine: 'Watch this fool.'

Mike: 'Ram him off the road.'

Martine: 'Oh I had a really good day today.
I didn't go till about half ten ah no cos I had a few letters and stuff to write first and I thought right I'll just take me time and, cos I wanted to I didn't wanna go faster than you know than I should, I should have done sort of thing cos I wanted to time it properly.
Erm it took me an hour and a quarter.
And it's exactly sixty miles into the middle of Caernarvon.
So I'

Mike: 'And that's where the survey's gonna be, right in the middle is it?'

Martine: 'Well no but that's where I had to go.
See you can allow a few extra miles for getting'

Mike: 'Oh.'

Martine: 'to the others.'

Mike: 'So you wanna allow yourself a an hour and half really don't you?
Do you think, or not?'

Martine: 'Well I don't think so because that, I mean there won't be any traffic hardly'

Mike: 'No.'

Martine: 'when I'm going so I'll just allow the same.
And then I should do it in an hour.
You know I'll be leaving at about half five.
No, not b about quarter past five I'll be leaving, five to quarter past.
That's allowing a a good hour and a quarter.
But it's not gonna take me longer at that time of the morning than it has done today at eleven o'clock or so is it?
Coming home it took me a bit longer cos it was all that delay at the [UNK] hill.'

Mike: 'Oh aye that's right I heard it on the radio.'

Martine: 'Yeah oh it's pathetic.
Oh no the rest of it, it's not too bad, it's not a bad journey, it's quite pleasant really.
So I went straight to the county offices and saw the rooms you know where we're going to'

Mike: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'be doing the coding.
Dead smart.
I was really into that.'

Mike: 'Can you put the stuff on the walls?'

Martine: 'Erm I'm not gonna put them on the walls.
They've got you know like these big boards, free standing boards'

Mike: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'they have.'

Mike: 'Like a pin board thing?'

Martine: 'Yeah.
Gonna have some of them there's three I think and they're really long ones.
Er so I'm gonna have them but she showed me the small room, what they call the small room, well that was huge well it will be perfect for what we want.
Really plush, you know all the carpets'

Mike: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'and everything?
Erm and then she said oh and this is the other one and it was like all er it was bigger again obviously, and all the tables in a square'

Mike: 'Like a conference type [UNK]'

Martine: 'Yeah but each seat ooh excuse me each seat had a microphone built into the desk.'

Mike: 'Oh aye?'

Martine: 'But I thought that'd be more of a hindrance than a help'

Mike: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'for what we were doing so when I got back to the office I rung and I tempor well provisionally booked this, the smallest of the two which I think will be brill.
So'

Mike: 'So what did she say about the money when you tried her for less money?
Or didn't you actually say?'

Martine: 'Well that one you have to ring the head office in Bangor, I had to ring her when I got back.
They only er showed me the rooms, they do the bookings and I just said'

Mike: 'And it's actually in the like the council offices?'

Martine: 'Yeah.
They have all like them chambers there as well you know?
But I just said that it was for the Welsh Office cos I thought if er they knew it was for a Authority you know?'

Mike: 'Yeah.'

Martine: '[UNK] I said do you, do you think there'd be any discount er with it being a block booking?
And she didn't say no full stop, she said oh she said I'm not sure she said, I'd have to enquire about that.
So I just thought she's gonna yeah if it was out of the question she could have said oh no that's it, there's a flat rate so I'

Mike: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'think she's gonna ask [UNK]'

Mike: '[UNK] thing is with them Welshies they probably haven't tried to bloody they haven't got the sense.'

Martine: 'No.'

Mike: 'If somebody else was trying to book it, one of those Welshy types, they haven't got the sense to ask [UNK]'

Martine: 'No, I said well I said that I'd appreciate it cos it's worth a go and she said oh yes I agree with you there.'

Mike: 'Which field's Min in?'

Martine: 'Not any of these.
So that was good.
Ooh I can't stop yawning.
So then I thought oh I'll go and find er the [UNK] offices again, Church Street.
And we'd gone a roundabout way the last time we were there and I thought oh I'll give it a go, anyway I walked straight down this road, have a look oh yes, turn up here anyway I, I sort of got me bearings and I thought oh yes it's just down here he's in the field just down there.'

Mike: 'Is he?
Do you wanna go or not or go straight to your nan's?'

Martine: 'Go straight to nan's, call on the way back.
If it isn't too late.
Couldn't see him.
Erm so I went straight to this place and there was a fella downstairs, his secretary was erm out on her lunch.
Anyway I said oh I said you're not expecting me, said who I was and where I was from.
I said I called in to see either Michael or the secretary, Mirelda her name is.'

Mike: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'And er so he said alright.
I said I'm also gonna be che cheeky and see if I can use your toi he said oh yes he said, go and help yourself he said there's a kettle down there, make yourself a drink, make yourself at home.
So anyway I thought I won't have a drink cos if this secretary wasn't there I didn't know how long she'd be so er but I di I went upstairs to where we had the meeting with Mike the other week.
And erm Joe his partner was there so I had a really good chat to him.'

Mike: 'What do you mean his partner like?
Is it just like a little firm?
And this Michael's one of the partners in the firm?'

Martine: 'No there's just them in the office.'

Mike: 'Oh aye.'

Martine: 'They've merged with us now.
Erm so I had a chat to him.
He drew me a little plan of how to get to W H Smiths and that.'

Mike: 'What the hell do you wanna go to Smiths for?'

Martine: 'Maps.
So I had a walk up the town and called in Tesco's and got a bit of shopping.
Got some teabags.'

Mike: 'Did you?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Mike: 'Is it much of a place, Caernarvon?'

Martine: 'Not really.'

Mike: 'They have a market there don't there?'

Martine: 'On a Saturday yeah.
So I went to Smiths, got this map'

Mike: 'What and do a photocopy?'

Martine: 'But I don't think I'll need it.
It's just a one to twenty five thousand, a Pathfinder.
Cos I picked up the Chester to Wrexham one instead of the Snowdonia one.
Caernarvon's on the Snowdonia map.'

Mike: 'Ah.'

Martine: 'An O S one to fifty thousand and that's what I thought I'd picked up this morning to take with me but when I looked it was Chester and Wrexham so it didn't do me much good.
So I thought oh well I'll buy this other one and'

Mike: 'Claim it back off the firm?'

Martine: 'Yes.
Three pound ninety something [UNK] [UNK] chicken butties and bag of crisps and that, it was nice.
Cos I'd parked on the top of this multi-storey car park at the [UNK] offices, is it called?
Erm I parked on the top.
So it wasn't all dark and that'

Mike: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'cos I wanted to be looking at me plans.
And I ate me butty there on top.'

Mike: 'In the pouring bloody rain and howling wind I expect.'

Martine: 'It was, yeah it was horrible.
So then I just had a drive round all the sites.'

Mike: 'Did you find them all alright?'

Martine: 'Yeah.
I know where I'm going now with er all of them.
You know and getting to them, I know how to get from one to the other without going, you know?'

Mike: 'All round the houses.'

Martine: 'I've got a good idea of where everywhere is.
So I was quite pleased.'

Mike: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'When I got back ooh you know I told you about that job?
We've put a bid in for Arrow Park.'

Mike: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'Rob thinks we've got it.'

Mike: 'Oh god.
Winning some bloody jobs aren't you.
What have they done, dropped their prices?'

Martine: 'Well Rob's doing them isn't he?
Oh they have had to drop their prices.
They've had to go for the we did them a few sort of quotes on the survey side of this Arrow Park and er we've gotta, you know, really stick to this tight budget because it's the only way you can get them no matter what people are telling you erm about the recession being over, people still want things for nothing.
So this survey might have to be done at the beginning of April.
But it's not a big one so'

Mike: 'Well when's these in Caernarvon, the end of April?'

Martine: 'Starting the twenty seventh of April.'

Mike: 'It's the weekend after [UNK]'s wedding?'

Martine: 'Yeah.
So I shall be enjoying myself at the wedding'

Mike: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'ready for my hard slog.'

Martine: 'Eh?'

Mike: 'You'll be knackered.'

Martine: 'I know.
Er yeah so we'll have this thing at Arrow Park to do.
He's hoping to do that.
We'll looking into doing we need to know how many cars gone in, how many cars go out'

Mike: 'Into the [UNK]?'

Martine: 'of the hospital grounds.
But there's residential sections as well.
And then see how long each vehicle stayed there.
There's two entra entrances'

Mike: 'You'll have to er take the registration of every bloody car!'

Martine: 'That's what we are doing.'

Mike: 'Jesus god!
It's probably because they're taking over the er accident and emergency department from Clatterbrick it's shutting down and it's all going to Arrow Park.'

Martine: 'Well that's not why we're doing it.'

Mike: 'Well it is.
That's what's happening, it was on the radio the other day.'

Martine: 'This is just well I mean it maybe connected with that but we're doing it because they want to increase the car parks [UNK].
So we're looking to do it with tape recorders on the busiest entrance and you know and just say car D five one four R G M blah blah blah.
Get them all down and then the person on the quieter entrance can just write them down.
But you don't necessarily have to say the whole number.
You know you can just say D five one four.'

Mike: 'Well that's what you wanna, so much quicker wouldn't it, just say the Escort D five one four.'

Martine: 'Yeah, you don't even have to say the the make.
And then erm they all get punched into the, Rob's got a special computer programme thing, you punch them all in er and then it does a ma a matching thing.
And it come, at the end of the day it comes out with all the ones it's matched, the duration it's been there and er makes it a damned sight easier basically.
Should be quite good.
Then we've got in June we're supposed to be doing journey time surveys and traffic counts on the M sixty three.'

Mike: 'I won't get off at this one, no?'

Martine: 'No.'

Mike: 'I'll get off at the [UNK]'

Martine: 'Erm now they're talking of doing roadside interviews in both directions on the motorway on the slip roads.'

Mike: 'Be a big job that will.'

Martine: 'Yeah.
So I hope it comes off.'

Mike: 'Loads of money [UNK], you'll be minted.'

Martine: 'Yeah.
It's about time we got something, don't, you know for months we scratched round looking like we're busy, now we're meeting ourselves backwards, coming backwards.'

Mike: 'Better that way though innit?
Days go [UNK]'

Martine: 'Yep.
But I mean I'm already starting stopping later, unintentionally you know, just cos I wanna finish something.'

Mike: 'Here I turn now do I?'

Martine: 'Yeah.
Well that this is the bloody supermarket. [UNK]'

Mike: 'Well where was the turning?

Martine: 'Course you do.'

Mike: 'I don't.'

Martine: 'Yes you do.
Er yeah I've already got over thirty hours credit.
And you're not supposed to have more than thirty even though Mike's got about a hundred and three.'

Mike: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'How the hell he's wangled it, honest to god!'

Mike: 'Well he must be fiddling it cos he, he's never bloody worked it.'

Martine: 'No.
So erm and I, I can't just take a flexi-day because I'm already, I've already got leave to use.
So I'm gonna see how I get on an if I keep doing it I'm just gonna get it as overtime.

Martine: 'That dancing concert what did you think?'

[UNK]: 'Well I shouldn't say this, I, I, I d I, I, I said it I haven't s really said it to Irene but I did say it to Con we went on the Friday didn't we?
Now er it wasn't that night I said it, it was afterwards so I said what did you think about the concert then [UNK]?
Well you tell me what you thought.
Well I said I tell you what I thought I said it was a funny ending to begin with wasn't it?'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'Didn't like have a finale did it?'

Martine: 'Not really.'

[UNK]: 'No not really, I mean it was sort of.
But we all sat there, we didn't know whether we ought to come out or not!
Anyhow I said well I shouldn't say this I know and I know times have altered, but I said it wasn't er I said I'm not saying it because Martine and Nicola were in it, but I said to me it wasn't the same as when they were in it.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'I said I know it was all this modern dancing sort of thing and there were a lot of elderly people there on Friday night.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'So well I didn't hear anyone say anything so I said well that's what I thought about it and er I did tell no I haven't said anything to Susan.
I mean the dancing was alright and all the children, don't get me wrong'

Martine: 'Yeah.
Just the things [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'And Mrs [UNK] works very hard well'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'I'm bound to say that.
But er like I say it's not like the old concerts.'

Martine: 'No.'

[UNK]: 'What did you think of it?'

Martine: 'Well I thought the sa I mean eve that last thing they did there the Starlight Express thing, I didn't have a clue what that was about.'

[UNK]: 'I didn't'

Martine: 'Erm and I didn't like the way erm she got a few of them's, a few of the gir I know there's only the two lads there, but how she was doing a lot of things with the girls dressed up as boys like that w er what was that song that me dad hates that they did?
Erm What a Dame'

[UNK]: 'Oh aye.'

Martine: 'what a dame.
Me dad hates that song, well there was the two lads and two girls pretending to be sailors or whatever they were.
I don't like the way she keeps trying to do that.'

[UNK]: 'No.'

Martine: 'Erm oh I dunno, some of their things were a bit weird weren't they?'

[UNK]: 'Well we're not all the same are we, but'

Martine: 'I suppose she's got a'

[UNK]: 'well your mum said to me well [UNK] I'll tell you the same as I've told Con but I said I'm not against the children or anything the children'

Martine: 'No.'

[UNK]: 'worked hard on their dancing, and they were lovely'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'and I like to see the little ones but er concert no.
Well she said I'm like you really she said'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'She said a and Irene said, Irene did say she wasn't very keen on this modern dancing.'

Martine: 'Yeah.
And the other thing is of course that Mrs [UNK] is d doing like she's taking the, the modern musicals and things that have been, you know, down in London, like Cats and Starlight Express and things and she's trying to imitate those, well there's no way she could ever get it as good so she's better off doing something completely different.
You know, something more traditional, you know like maybe doing a few things out of The Sound of Music.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'Or, you know, that people ooh yes, that's it, The Sound of Music.
I think that'd go down bett or I mean even like when we did the pantomimes, you remember Cinderella we did?'

Martine: 'I mean it was brilliant really wasn't it?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah'

Martine: 'For like such a amateur er company to do, but people loved it because they they understood everything that was going on.
There was dancing in it, there was singing in it.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'Er I think she's a bit too ambitious sometimes.
And we were right in the front row and that ruddy music she had!
Were you near the front?'

[UNK]: 'Ooh that but do you know she has the music too high'

Martine: 'Too loud.'

[UNK]: 'for th even when, when the children are singing'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'you can't, I know I don't hear very well, but it was too h too high for to hear them singing.'

Martine: 'Yeah it drowning them out.'

[UNK]: 'That's what I thought when that little boy, I mean he was lovely singing that'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'on his own [UNK]'

Martine: 'That was her youngest, her lad.'

[UNK]: 'That's her youngest boy.
Ah he was lovely, bless him.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'But er, like I said they've they do work, she does work very hard with them and er but Mrs [UNK] hasn't got a way with her at all has she?'

Martine: 'Not really.
No.'

[UNK]: 'No.
Never has, and she'll never change now'

Martine: 'No.'

[UNK]: 'will she?'

Martine: 'No.
Oh we were having a laugh.
Remember when we did that space ship scene?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'And we had the guns'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'and we were saying about her mum, Mrs [UNK] don't you knacker them B guns!
Do you remember her shouting at me and Nicola for'

Martine: 'firing them?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'Cos we said them young kids that had the trumpets for that thing, I bet she had a go at them and all not to knacker them.'

[UNK]: 'Ooh dear'

Martine: 'Ooh dear me'

[UNK]: 'But still I said to er Con well, oh well I said to Irene I did, I said it's good for [UNK] er [UNK].'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'They get a lot of money out of it don't they?'

Martine: 'They do.'

[UNK]: 'They get all the door money.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'And they get er the raffle'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'the money from the raffle as well.
Well I mean they don't have a great lot so a concert, did you see the dresses?
They were, weren't hemmed or anything.
Well I said that's understandable, she said well.'

Martine: 'Well [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'And I said she never used to do the hem, the er hems when'

Martine: 'No, no.'

[UNK]: 'Nicola and Martine were in it.
But then again I said perhaps they'll have to perhaps they'll be thrown on one side some of them.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'They'll never be used again.
And to be honest I said it wasn't worth wasting a lot of time on them.'

Martine: 'No.'

[UNK]: 'Because it was only cheap er material'

Martine: 'Well that's it.'

[UNK]: 'wasn't it?'

Martine: 'Yeah.
I must admit I did recognize a few outfits that me and Nicola used to wear.
Honestly.'

[UNK]: 'Did you?'

Martine: 'Yeah.
These orange tops, we used to do a dance to Vandervalk.
You know that do do do doo do do doo do do doo doo doo do do.
I recogni I said mum that's the ruddy Vandervalk costumes.
These orange ti we, we used to think they were lovely.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, yeah.'

Martine: 'Erm recognized those and a couple of other things.
Erm and me mum was saying how Dyllis [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'remember with Helen and Susan?
Erm when they were doing the dance thingies cos she was a dressmaker, Dyllis was, she used to say look at these!
She hasn't even put seams on them.
And she used to do Helen and Susan's, she used to sew all the edges up and everything.'

[UNK]: 'Did she?'

Martine: 'Oh aye.
On every costume.
She wasn't letting her kids go out'

[UNK]: 'Well [UNK] the sleeves you can't notice well I said I noticed'

Martine: 'Yeah, all fraying.'

[UNK]: 'I said but, but I said I knew'

Martine: 'Well that's it.'

[UNK]: 'that she didn't do any hems or anything.'

Martine: 'When you're making all that lot'

[UNK]: 'No.'

Martine: 'I don't suppose you're bothered whether they've got hems and neat edges on them.'

[UNK]: 'And what was it said was it your mum said she's not very well or something, Mrs [UNK]'s mother.
And she's had to have someone to help her to do, to'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'make the dresses this time.'

Martine: 'Yeah she hadn't done them all this time.
I said you could pick out the ones Ma [UNK] had done.
They were the ones with the tatty sleeves.
Ooh.'

[UNK]: 'Ah dear me [UNK]'

Martine: 'We thoroughly enjoyed it, having said that.'

[UNK]: 'Oh yes!'

Martine: 'I was'

[UNK]: 'Oh I enjoyed it, don't get me wrong.'

Martine: 'Yeah.
It was'

[UNK]: 'But er'

Martine: 'a nice change as well.'

[UNK]: 'but I suppose the likes of me, bit old fashioned aren't we?
And there'd be a lot more like me, those elderly people that were there.'

Martine: 'Well that's it.'

[UNK]: 'You know they would rather see the old concerts.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'Do you know what I mean?
But I know'

Martine: 'I, I do.'

[UNK]: 'Mrs [UNK] has got to work with the times hasn't she?'

Martine: 'Well I suppose so.
Because that's the thing like, although if she did something a bit more traditional, it'd probably please the likes of us but when you think, the kids that are doing it, if she says oh we're doing something out of Starlight Express it'll be aah!
Oh!
You know, I mean that would appeal to them'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Martine: 'because they'd think it was really important and'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'and they'd probably rather wanna d rather do that that'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'than something, you know like a pantomime or something.
But er these'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Martine: 'these met us Dad and Mike met us in the pub after.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah'

Martine: 'but she had a miscarriage when she went home'

[UNK]: 'Yes she lost the baby'

[UNK]: 'Oh dear'

Martine: 'erm sort of, at fir, you know, at first I thought sometimes you know oh, you know what's the matter with you like but, she admits herself, her I Q, you know how they judge your intelligence has gone right down, she has to have tests every now and again, er she can't concentrate on things, or, you know some things she just can't do any more, so she's at, supposed to be getting all this compensation and it's been going on now, it was two years ago, three years ago that we met them and she's only just had the first part of her money, she's had five thousand pounds, that's all she can get for the time being all the rest is, cos all solicitors and everything and doctors having to come and check things, so she knows, she knows she'll get money eventually, but er, it's just when, but isn't it an awful thing?
Ah'

[UNK]: 'Well Valerie was, she was the same weren't she?'

Martine: 'That's right, yeah she'll be going through all the same thing trying to get money'

[UNK]: 'Ooh, oh no'

Martine: 'No'

[UNK]: 'so the engagement was broken off and then after that she sort of she went to live in a flat, she left home and went to live in a flat and she's been up and down'

Martine: 'Mm'

[UNK]: 'in Rochet, now she's up in Pentrybrogan, and that's when the accident happened'

[UNK]: 'and er they said well they, they'll have no trouble with er compensation'

Martine: 'No'

[UNK]: 'It wasn't the man's fault really of Shell, it was another car really that caused the'

Martine: 'Mm'

[UNK]: 'trouble sort of thing, but er I don't know whether they bought it thinking they'll have all this money or what but er'

Martine: 'No'

[UNK]: 'I don't think they're short of money to be honest cos Valerie has a good job'

Martine: 'I know it's nice to have the compensation, but when you think of what you're missing'

[UNK]: 'Oh the money isn't everything is it?'

Martine: 'That's it it's nothing at the end of the day'

[UNK]: 'It will only buy so much, it won't buy everything money won't.'

Martine: 'What if you lose the use of your hand it won't buy that back'

Martine: 'I think she's going off it a bit so I said oh well I'll come and have a chat and I said listen, I said, I realize you you've got a lot of school work and that and you've got your boyfriend, I said, but there is now way that you're gonna let him stand in the field, getting fat and getting old you've got'

[UNK]: 'He's got to have exercise'

Martine: 'yeah I said if you've lost interest in him then all you have to do is tell me, I said there'll be plenty of other people'

[UNK]: 'Would like'

Martine: 'you know plenty of other little girls that would want to look after him, and I said it's no good relying on Vicky because she, the little sister, she's nine, she was too young to do things by herself, you know, I said there's no way you can let, leave it all to Vicky, so that if you don't want him any more you must tell me and I said there'll be no hard feelings but that's it, cos he comes first at the end of the day, so she said oh I, oh I have been naughty have you been?'

Mike: 'Yeah'

Martine: 'He's been to the toilet already'

Martine: 'Good god lad, so erm, she said oh I know I've been naughty and I have, not neglecting him in a naut, you know, they've been making sure he's been alright'

[UNK]: 'Yeah I know'

Martine: 'but just riding him, well that's what he needs, so I said well you just see as you think on just keep exercising him, so erm, after that she's been alright and the little sister's getting really good with him'

[UNK]: 'Ah'

Martine: 'erm, because she's, she's quite big for her age, but like Louise she's quite tall now, she's nearly too tall for him even though there's nothing of her she must only be about seven stone, erm, but this little Vicky she's oh thinking she's really good now and she's improved so much and getting confident as well, and the dad takes in, he puts the bridle on him, he takes the dog in one hand and Min in the other he goes for walks for miles with the, with the horse and the dog Dave does'

Martine: 'he loves it, goes for miles with them'

[UNK]: 'Good lord'

Martine: 'Or, like he, if the little girl's riding him, he always goes with her then as well, but even if the girl's not on him, he takes him for a walk like a big dog so I mean, they're lovely people, you couldn't wish to have him with nicer people, erm, you know they are, they really are nice'

[UNK]: 'Yes but he spends a lot doesn't he Martine?'

Martine: 'Well that's it, erm, like she, I don't think she makes a fortune, she only makes enough probably for food and that, he doesn't make that much off his dad because his dad's a stingy thing, but he does the taxing as well and he does foreigners, but erm, you know, like they've got their bills to pay and everything, they don't economize on anything, they have massive gas bills and'

[UNK]: 'And they've just had a new car haven't they?'

Martine: 'Yeah, so they're paying that off, er I think, I think they're mad, I really do they only, they only pay a hundred and odd pound a month for this mortgage they've got at the moment because they bought it, it was only sixteen thousand, well it was cheap it was before the boom'

Martine: 'well we can count the panelling that we've got left over there, how many do we use a day?'

Martine: 'To be honest I can't remember, I know my lot on the last thing Wigan was doing two hundred and thirty an hour, so twelve times twenty, two hundred and thirty'

Martine: 'If we allow two hundred'

None: 'Well thanks a lot Bill, bye'

Martine: 'interviews'

Martine: 'Mm, two and a half thousand then'

Martine: 'an hour'

Martine: 'that's a box'

Martine: 'that's only a hundred interview forms an hour isn't it?'

Martine: 'Of course, yeah, because there's two on a sheet'

Martine: 'And that's allowing for spares as well, cos my sites aren't gonna be busy enough to do that, that many anyway I wouldn't of thought, so what you doing twelve hundred a day?'

Martine: 'Mhm, it's, isn't there two and a half in a box?'

Martine: 'Is it?
I don't know'

Martine: 'Have we got one over there?'

Martine: 'So that's three thousand six hundred so if I add four thousand, three and a half to four thousand'

Martine: 'Mm, mm'

Martine: 'I'd be well in the clear then'

Martine: 'two, there's two and a half'

Martine: 'nine and a half boxes over here'

Martine: 'And how many's in a box?'

Martine: 'There's no lid on it so I can't tell'

Martine: 'Oh'

Martine: 'erm'

Martine: 'Is there no lids on them at all?'

Martine: 'No'

Martine: 'so there's two and a half thousand'

Martine: 'so there's five thousand interviews we could do five thousand interviews with that?
Hang on there's gotta be something wrong there, that means I'm only gonna need a box at the most, doesn't it, hang on, let's write it out'

Martine: 'Start at the very beginning, there's two and a half thousand'

Martine: 'That's allowed, the maximum that we could do is two hundred interviews an hour'

Martine: 'Yeah okay'

Martine: 'would you agree with that?'

Martine: 'which is a hundred forms'

Martine: 'Would you agree?'

Martine: 'Mm, mm'

Martine: 'Two hundred interviews per hour, equals one hundred interview sheets there's been some very good cases of sexual harassment lately and'

Martine: 'Mm'

Martine: 'they're getting millions in compensation'

None: 'Check the information with you'

Martine: 'erm, so'

None: 'I don't even know what they are'

None: 'er I'm not sure if I didn't'

Martine: 'You know when people talk about you and they don't actually ask you they just mention things and hated'

None: 'Is anybody talking about me?'

Martine: 'so that's'

None: 'Sorry, right'

Martine: 'two thousand for'

None: 'Excuse me'

Martine: 'Yes mate'

None: 'did I ask you to bring'

Martine: 'no only the red boxes, I thought they were already done'

Martine: 'Well, erm'

Martine: 'which I've sorted this morning'

None: 'right have you sorted them, right, so you've done, what are these things?'

Martine: 'Don't know with them'

Martine: 'Don't know what Scott's already archived but why they weren't put in boxes away somewhere I've no idea'

None: 'These meant to be archived are they?'

Martine: 'Well or at least sorted, maybe they're the ones that was supposed to be left out for future reference.'

Martine: 'I thought they'd already been done'

None: 'I, produced a list of what's already inside here, er, these calculate are the files registered, they're not numbered so they wouldn't be registered, but they would surely'

Martine: 'So Rob's instruction was that he put them in those files and I didn't think it was a particularly good idea because everything's easier to find if it's in the envelopes that we've put them in.'

None: 'Now here, he's put down the interview date that was here, yeah he was starting to transfer the interview days across and I'

Martine: 'This is er'

None: 'I stopped him, I said don't do that leave them in the envelopes and mark them as they are, so what'

Martine: 'We, actually I think we stopped him doing that because we put information on the envelopes as well which he didn't see'

Martine: 'Yeah we divided them all up, but if me or Jan needed to refer to anything we'd recognize the information that we've put on the envelopes quicker than we'll recognize the stuff that he's put in there'

Martine: 'We realized too late anyway before we'

None: 'Is he, did, he's labelled this wrong anyway, he's called this interviewed date for data fifty three, but it isn't interview data, it's count data oh Wigan do you'

Martine: 'If you put it with that pile of envelopes Mike'

None: 'can you sort that out cos that is Wigan and'

None: 'if you leave them in the pile fair enough and I think they can go to archive, but please can you re-title the contents page and the pages cos they're not interview data it's count data, er I would of thought by now Scott knew the difference between interview and account'

Martine: 'Why he's never done an interview'

None: 'Well to be fair you're right, but I would of thought someone'

Merielle: 'Well he told me he'd gone for a count'

None: 'sorry'

Merielle: 'He said he'd gone for a count for a job'

None: 'Oh it's a good job we've got one wit in the team, I wonder where he is?
Posy, er right where are we?'

Martine: 'Two hundred interview per hour equals four hundred and three sheets'

Martine: 'three thousand'

Merielle: 'Sixty three, seventy nine'

Martine: 'That's it'

Merielle: 'no'

None: 'See again, he could of put some dates in'

None: 'so, I, this needs proper registering'

Merielle: 'Yeah'

None: 'been on file'

Merielle: 'well I've got another file that needs proper registering'

None: 'yeah, but again I should just get some of these checked, every content, you know that the heading'

Merielle: 'Mm'

None: 'it, they look'

None: 'it hasn't done interviews unfortunately'

Merielle: 'Right'

None: 'okay'

Martine: 'No, no, no, we only need a hundred sheets an hour'

None: 'Hello mm, mm'

Martine: 'and there's twelve hours so we'll only need a thousand and two hundred'

Martine: 'Mm, mm'

None: 'Which one is it?'

Martine: 'so call it half a box'

Martine: 'Mm, mm'

[UNK]: 'Wilf [UNK] telephone call, Wilf [UNK] telephone'

Martine: 'Mm, mm'

Martine: 'two boxes, er'

Martine: 'that's er ten whole boxes'

Martine: 'six thousand so'

None: 'right now you'll have'

Martine: 'so what did we just say for you?
You need six thousands do you?'

Martine: 'Yeah'

Martine: 'divided by'

None: 'I'm not even sure, we don't even know his name'

Martine: 'so let's give you three'

None: 'Well my understand of control is'

None: 'is one at control that you can call back in or destroyed and be replaced by'

None: 'so the control copy should always be'

Martine: 'and I want two boxes'

Martine: 'we've already got four and a half boxes'

None: 'It's a very loose definition and one which'

Martine: 'so let's order two for us and that'll give us five and a half, six and a half boxes'

Martine: 'another half box spare'

Martine: 'but I mean there's spares in them anyway'

Martine: 'yeah'

Merielle: 'but we never actually said anything to control, we only say what's wrong with the job'

None: 'and why, why people suddenly started saying we've got to go around marking'

None: 'what we should be doing is marking control, control'

[UNK]: 'Or doing nothing'

None: 'or doing nothing'

[UNK]: 'and say nothing to control'

None: 'Yeah we could possibly'

None: 'there's no guarantee'

None: 'which there can't be can there, and say it gets lost in the post then you're not gonna have it updated'

Martine: 'No'

None: 'no'

None: 'and automatically assumed'

None: 'that, if it's important'

None: 'even, even within our own little team'

Martine: 'No I'm sure your mum and dad will not find that'

None: 'and we should have systems whereby if you were'

Martine: 'what's more I'm convinced it'

None: 'and you can guarantee that you'

None: 'still a human error even though you know how to do it, and we cannot guarantee that you'll do it so it, so it is, the, it is very important that nobody takes anything off the shelf automatically assume'

Martine: 'Mind you no point in'

None: 'It does matter we really need to know whether to make necessary phone calls'

Martine: 'Ask Tracey how, whether they order them by the box or whatever'

Martine: 'Where, does Tracey'

Martine: 'Could you'

Merielle: 'You won't get the number of ten'

Martine: 'Good stuff, good stuff'

Martine: 'erm'

Merielle: 'You'll probably go get the'

Merielle: 'just got really unsafe unless the two sites are like half a mile, well at least half a mile if not, but I'

Merielle: 'hand signal'

Martine: 'When you say in two direction, I mean we there's no way they let you interview on the main line'

Martine: 'Erm we switch you on five'

Merielle: 'Yeah'

Martine: 'so we're talking slip roads'

Martine: 'and you know how to test for'

Martine: 'right, I don't think you'll get a free representation of the traffic flow'

Martine: 'erm'

Martine: 'if you do road to'

Martine: 'yeah'

Martine: 'I mean look, and even so I mean depending on where it's gonna be'

Merielle: 'Yeah'

Martine: 'If you've got signs on the main line saying traffic point, traffic censors ahead, you're gonna have people saying oh sod that I'll get off at the next junction instead'

Merielle: 'Yeah'

Martine: 'wouldn't you, I don't know how you'll get round it'

Martine: 'Alright, I'll phone you a bit later on before I leave, okay.'

Martine: 'Wouldn't you Jan?'

Martine: 'Like, this is that from the D T P that?'

Merielle: 'That is, yeah'

Martine: 'That is saying that erm despite the additional costs'

Martine: 'yeah'

Martine: 'we want it done in both directions, there's no way you can do it on the main line'

Martine: 'No'

Martine: 'so you're talking slip roads'

Martine: 'Yeah'

Martine: 'er Graham seems to think they're hinting that they should be done on the same day'

Martine: 'No way, I said before you can't do that'

Martine: 'Well no'

Martine: 'because'

Martine: 'the safe, the safety aspect of it and I don't think you'll get a true representation of the traffic flows if you did it both together cos like you say people will be diverting'

Merielle: 'Mm'

Martine: 'Yeah, if they're delayed getting on the motorway and see that they're doing it the other side coming off, they might be saying'

Martine: 'and go up'

Martine: 'Yeah, but'

Martine: 'to the next junction and get off'

Martine: 'one, M sixty three six to nine this is, isn't it?'

Merielle: 'Mm'

Martine: 'So junction six is that the big mass oh no junction seven'

Martine: 'Junctions five and six'

Martine: 'Yeah, so where you gonna go now?'

Martine: 'and junction nine is the one where you come off and go to Ernston that way'

Martine: 'Mm'

Martine: 'which is not a very, but what I'm saying to Graham is if we do it on a slip road like, cos, cos I've never done one before, if you, you'd have to have warning signs if you got a census on the slip coming off'

Martine: 'people are gonna say oh well I'll get off at the next one'

Martine: 'That's what I said to you'

Merielle: 'Unless they're gonna do them on the roads there's the motorway, that's Manchester, unless they're gonna do them on the roads'

Martine: 'Around'

Martine: 'Yeah'

Martine: 'yeah well'

Merielle: 'going in'

Martine: 'er, I'll go for that one'

Merielle: 'because you'll be able to pick up M sixty three using the non M sixty three uses that one'

Martine: 'Yeah, I'll go for that'

Martine: 'Yeah'

Merielle: 'but then you've got the two directional aspect and like the cyclones either side of the road, they can't be opposite each other, it's'

Martine: 'No'

Merielle: 'the'

Merielle: 'states, they've got to be accurate, they've got to be at least half a mile apart'

Martine: 'yeah but if they, if they were on slips they wouldn't be opposite anyway, would they?'

Merielle: 'You can't mess about'

Martine: 'Well you know you could do one at the slip'

Merielle: 'Yeah, there wouldn't be'

Martine: 'Oh no, no'

Martine: 'You've got to do one on the slip off and one on the slip on, at the same part'

Merielle: 'Yeah'

Martine: 'Having not done one I wouldn't know how they go about it even'

Martine: 'I know it has been done, but when, For Ormskirk we wanted, we were looking to interview at the end of the M fifty eight'

Merielle: 'Yeah'

Martine: 'and erm, about a hundred, most of it was under Manchester'

Martine: 'Oh for Ormskirk as well'

Merielle: 'Yes'

Martine: 'isn't it, er the junction there, and there was all erm deceleration lines and that across the road, they were slowing down anyway and we were gonna really narrow the cones and they were approaching a roundabout so I'

Merielle: 'Yeah'

Martine: 'mean they had to stop eventually, but they wouldn't buy it at all, no way'

Martine: 'Same as'

Martine: 'didn't think they'd accept that the two different police forces, one said yes the other said no, but then they stood'

Martine: 'Yeah, one was from Delmonte Road wasn't it?'

Martine: 'That's the one, he's the one who said no they're not'

Martine: 'Yeah he was on the other end of the'

Martine: 'Do you really think that the Jolly Green Giant puts the lights on at two o'clock in the morning and gets them all to pick the corn?'

Martine: 'Yeah, why do you think it's a lie?'

Martine: 'You destroyed my dreams, my dreams are destroyed'

Martine: 'I was dead upset'

Merielle: 'I can't get upset about that no, cos I'

Martine: 'yes'

Martine: 'yeah, that's what I thought and, but if that wasn't bad enough, my mum because she knows these things, even said that he doesn't even say ho, ho, ho, Green Giant, doesn't, they don't even sing that song when they're working they couldn't sing, and you know the little corn on the cob man'

Nora: 'That was ages ago.'

Martine: 'Cos there was already a a difference.'

Martine: 'Yeah.'

Nora: 'it weakens and breaks it off.'

Martine: 'Why who told you that, Wayne?'
