One or two have mentioned on Thursday actually so I think best we're open well before.
See how that goes when they feel it.'

Barry: 'Well I was just talking to Jean about that today, I mean I we've gotta keep on doing it but, I think that'

Ken: 'Yeah, if you stop now you'll get nowhere with them will you?'

Barry: 'No that's right.
But I mean I think we, I think I, I will need on Monday morning to talk to er Morecambe Bay and see if I can bring forward these promotions because'

Ken: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'until I start'

Ken: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'I mean, we should get them back.'

Ken: 'You can't, al also I think you should start doing, having people regular again wi it's just'

Barry: 'I know.'

Ken: 'not worth it.'

Barry: 'The trouble is it's a bit of a catch twenty two because if you don't put a bus on, will you get the people?'

Ken: 'Mm.
It's what you do innit?
That's the problem with it. [UNK]'

Barry: '[UNK] the bus for er'

Ken: 'I mean nobody actually'

Barry: 'and nobody on it.'

Ken: 'nobody's actually said to me a well where, where's the bus on a Thursday?
Nobody's said it yet.
When they'

Barry: 'Mm mm.'

Ken: 'start asking'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Ken: 'then that transport you could ask about putting it back on again.'

Barry: 'I mean what a what I think I'll probably do is if we can get like erm something that's obviously our crowd and then either putting, say, Stella back on or something like that'

Ken: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'and banging it out for one [UNK]'

Ken: 'Can you not stick a band on pretty soon or nothing like that?'

Barry: 'Well'

Ken: 'People would think we were'

Barry: 'frankly I'm not sure where that stands [UNK].
I mean talking to Charlie, just asking about getting some student bands on'

Ken: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'might be an idea cos remember when we had that thin Mar'

Barry: 'when we had that thin Martin's band on.'

Ken: 'Yeah, but I was in [UNK]'

Barry: 'I mean'

Ken: 'gonna say, stick them back on cos they'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'They brought a big following.
Yeah, that's right.'

Ken: 'Er, I mean if you, if they, if they'

Barry: 'There was about a hundred with thin Martin on the other hand.'

Ken: 'Yes.
Yes.
It was a really good night that.
If you make it known that there's stuff like that going on, if you get a band like that you can always just'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Ken: 'put a bus on for some people that come down.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Ken: 'You get a couple of leads like that it'll start picking up'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Ken: 'up there.'

Barry: 'That's right.
So'

Ken: 'Like ya, like you say it is a difficult situation at the moment innit?'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Ken: 'And what to do for the best.'

Barry: 'Mm.
Yeah.
But I, I say if I get sh publicity I er if I say do, if I say cos we haven't got a premium lager on draft so if I stick Stella on draught'

Alan: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'What, you go out in the i is it in the summer when you go out the boat?
Or the erm spring or summat?'

Alan: 'Well, summer, I don't know I'd like to go for about it, whe whether it's calm or not, you know if it's nice and calm but'

Barry: 'Mhm.'

Alan: 'well that's a a place like Morecambe I just couldn't be bothered.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'So I go at any time late at night.

So that didn't go down too well with our lot but it's either that or it blow up all the time.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Do you go out far?
Or do you just you fe in a'

Barry: 'in a boat or do you go out far?'

Alan: 'Depends, last time we went out, we went just off Longbay Island other side of Wallasey.'

Barry: 'Yeah I know.

Alan: 'So one guy caught a twenty eight pounder like.
You know good fishing out there.
But otherwise you stop in harbour fish [UNK].'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'You can take your chance.'

Barry: 'How long how long can you stay out?
I mean I, you know, how long does th'

Alan: 'Usually if'

Barry: 'how long's the tide and that?'

Alan: 'if you go out on a charter it's twelve hours you know, if you go for'

Barry: 'Yeah, but then you're going out a distance aren't you?'

Alan: 'To other side of Wallasey you do twelve'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'hours.'

Barry: 'No, I mean if you just keep using the bay'

Alan: 'Oh aye.'

Barry: 'the bay.'

Alan: 'I can, certainly you can float for [UNK] and the moor.'

Barry: 'Mm.

Alan: 'You can float from, but you get a lot of soft wind.'

Barry: 'Right.'

Alan: 'But, plenty of them around.
I never use them as well as my own.
That's'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'right.'

Barry: 'Is there much mackerel around?'

Alan: 'In boat?
Er like when you go out and catch mackerel you use it for fresh bait then.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'So'

Barry: 'See, it's not a bad fish to eat actually, mackerel.
Mind you, we don't eat fish.'

Alan: 'No.'

Barry: 'And I went to last summer we took a er I took a sha er not a sha erm tt static caravan in, at er Prestatyn an and erm'

Alan: 'Mhm.'

Barry: 'and like, we were just flicking through Ceefax on the telly and it was like one of these luxury six berth ones and it was ninety nine quid for a week and, and'

Alan: 'Really?'

Barry: 'I mean it was beautiful inside!
They're normally like a two hundred and fifty, three hundred quid one'

Alan: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'but it was it was cos you had you know, you had to go that week kind of thing.
So we just thought well [UNK] then.
Erm I took the nine year old boat out and just went out in a boat we had Mary went as well, we were like the all [UNK] job for mackerel put this guy's'

Alan: 'Mhm.'

Barry: 'twelve guys on, that's what I didn't want two small mackerel caught in over'

Alan: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'three hours, you know.
Poor guy was going, well I don't understand it, you know, normally we Went to erm Malta last year and there was a great erm tt it's called an underwater safari, but, you know, normally when you're, like on Windermere like you've got a glass-bottomed boats'

Alan: 'Oh have they?'

Barry: 'well this was the all, the ho all the hull underneath the water line was glass so you were actually sitting you know, you weren't looking down, you were actually sitting in, in the base of the hull of the boat'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'and, and going, and they went er it went out in, off to er some of these islands off er rocks and that, tour of [UNK] Malta and that it was superb!
You were abs you know you were er absolute, I mean it was, it was'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'as good as aqualunging without actually getting wet, it was great you know!
Very good idea that.
Must have made a fortune!
It was packed like three or four times a day.'

Alan: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

Barry: 'I mean people are fascinated by the sea aren't they?
They really are.'

Alan: 'Oh yeah.
My wife's just gone America shark fishing.'

Barry: 'Oh yeah!

Alan: 'Oh aye.'

Barry: 'for the twelve hours don't you?'

Alan: 'Oh yeah.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'He went out he went fly-drive last year, and he went down'

Barry: 'Have you seen that'

Alan: 'to Mexico.'

Barry: 'have you seen that movie, it was on erm tt I was watching a programme the other day about it.
They've developed a camera for your line for th for the mackerel, for the ma marlin and the shark fishing erm and basically you can actually watch you can, you can ac you've got a your T V screen so it, it's er, it's like a spectator sport as well cos you can actually watch the, the, the fish coming to take your bait.'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'You know, so it's like yo you've got on this minute camera on the line and everything, you know so it, so that you can actually get the excitement of watching it you know, coming and taking'

Ken: 'Can we have a little bit of a discount?'

Barry: 'Yeah you can.
Course you can.'

Ken: 'How much is it then?'

Barry: 'Couple of quid each.'

Ken: 'Couple of quid each!
Couple of quid each!
So we can start'

Barry: 'Shark fishing's only [UNK]'

Alan: 'That's all you have, that's only have to have a little bit.'

Barry: 'Yeah!
Yeah!'

Alan: 'You've asked for a lot!'

Ken: 'Can we have a lot of a discount please?'

Alan: 'Only gotta drink, drink, drink that's lots of drink a drink.'

Ken: 'A drink a drink!'

Barry: 'Give us three quid for the pair of you.'

Alan: 'Right.
You give him three quid and I'll give the rest in.'

Barry: 'Cheers.'

Alan: 'Yeah.
So you buy first two beers then.'

Alan: 'Yeah.
Fair enough.'

Ken: 'No!'

Alan: 'Well isn't it?'

Ken: 'Well I did [UNK]'

Barry: 'The guy was talking to Pete, he thought he could, he develop, he could develop for coarse fishing'

Hugh: 'Bye bye.'

Barry: 'er, you know river fishing and that as well, there's spa special camera.'

Alan: 'Well where does the actual camera hang off?'

Barry: 'It's hung, it it's hung, i i it's actually not below the boat but, but it'

Hugh: 'Oh!
Sure can.'

Barry: 'get it, you see, but i it's fantastic watching cos you know they were they, they it was sort of going along the'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'whatever they were using as bait presumably some mackerel or something like that but, but as I was saying you could see it trailing through and then all, suddenly out of like nowhere this fish would come and like chase after it'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'and snap and this, this would go off and you'd be sat there going right then, you actually'

Alan: 'Well presumably'

Barry: 'see it take it, you know'

Alan: 'the camera eye would be adjustable would it?
Or'

Barry: 'I presume so, yes.
I mean they was talking about getting a really small for erm'

Alan: 'Oh right.'

Barry: 'you know, to be, to be used in in sort of coarse fishing and that.'

Alan: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'But, of course, the other thing of course, i it takes out the, the one that got away cos you actually see the one that got away'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'you know?'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'There'd be some story then.'

Alan: 'You know what'll happen is your camera would'

Alan: 'the cameras'll magnify it anyway won't it?'

Barry: 'Yeah it will.
It will do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it was really, I mean it, it meant of course that the other people on the boat could have some enjoyment as well, cos I mean, there's nothing worse i if you if there's only one rod out, or two rods out th those boats there's only like a couple of rods out int there on, on'

Alan: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'those for the marlin and the and the sharks and that, fishing?'

Alan: 'And you don't get many.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
And it's not like, sort of'

Alan: 'Three there'll be'

Barry: 'twelve'

Alan: 'three or four maximum'

Barry: 'twelve rods out, yeah.'

Alan: 'something like that.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
So any anybody else that's going on board is bored out their brains basically!
But at least'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'if you got T V monitors you can watch what's going'

Alan: 'Watch it.'

Barry: 'on.'

Alan: 'That's really good.'

Barry: 'So now, now I mean now with all the radar and whatever else we're using, I mean you should really be able to find fish.'

Alan: 'Well that, that boat from Evesham that we went out on a couple a years ago it had a fish finder on it.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'So it er, [UNK] fish finder on it.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'You throw your line out, you don't get a few just biting.'

Barry: 'No.
No, that's right.
That's right.
They've done most of them are I mean the wo certainly the ones on the little little boat trips and that, I mean, they have all it does is that it'll tell you there's some fish about, I mean, it doesn't'

Alan: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'tell you where to fish or'

Alan: 'Oh no.'

Barry: 'depths or anything like that does it?
What they're doing is there's some fish down there somewhere.'

Alan: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'Cos that's the most frustrating thing about fishing is when you're like you know, you could be wasting that, you, you think to yourself like I could be wasting a whole, there's not a fish anywhere round here!
You know, you could be sat here like an idiot today'

Alan: 'Well that's it I've I've sat on'

Barry: 'for hours on end.'

Alan: 'Jay hours on end in middle of night freezing'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'you know like [UNK] and I've caught nothing.
And you've'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'thought well there's plenty of crabs in'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'summer, take your bait'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'but every time you throw out there's a crab on end of it.
You know'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

Alan: 'you think, why does that crab always have to come my line.'

Alan: 'And all this sea yet it has to get my worm.
And same, like no fish, you think well there must be fish out there.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'Well it's, it's luck innit?
I don't know.'

Barry: 'I don't know what's going on.
I don't we got about three, three thirty in the morning, both of them went out to er canal somewhere up Dulgate, past Dulgate we set up and we'd we'd been fishing for about two and half hours it's aba about six thirty in the morning this old farmer comes up says er aye, aye lads, he said er I wouldn't bother it, they drained this area of the canal a few months ago!
And we said, oh!'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Sat there watching our floats for hours!
I mean'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'I mean luckily you, you know, you'd gone on a car, with a car so it's a matter of throwing everything in the back and just going'

Alan: 'That's it.'

Barry: 'somewhere else so could have sat there all bleeding day!
And not have known anything about it.'

Alan: 'Aye.
I've had some lonely nights.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Do you catch many eels, eels or anything, many eels?'

Alan: 'No.'

Alan: 'Didn't catch as many this year as what I have done.
Phworgh!
The slimy things that they are.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'You get one of the lads that works with me, if he catches three of them he says well I'll have them for my dinner.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
I know.
I know.'

Alan: 'They look horrible!'

Barry: 'A delicacy.
Mind you, I ate conga.
I, I erm, I was off the west co er on a holiday to the west coast of Ireland and we erm we're driving down the west coast and there was like some rocks and everything about, so we stopped and, you know, I looked [UNK] by a rock pools or something, and there's this and the rock pool is like mini-swimming baths, they were, you know, probably'

Alan: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'twelve foot long and about six or seven foot wide and about'

Alan: 'Mm mm.'

Barry: 'six or seven foot deep and they're crystal clear.
And there was this old guy dragging this bloody rope with a massive hook on the end like after after, you know, I presume it was cod or mackerel something along the and I said, what the hell are you fishing?
You know cos the woman I was with wanted to go for a swim and I said no you can't this guy [UNK], so I went up to him, I said what, what on earth are you fishing for?
He said, oh there's three congas live in this pool.
It was like a four foot one, a five foot one, there's a six foot one over in the centre, there's a rock in the centre of it'

Alan: 'Oh right.'

Barry: 'that came out the water said look over there.
I said bloody hell!
You know, and I said to her you were gonna go swimming in there!
He said ooh, he said there was some American students here last week and they were all swimming in there and the man came along with this thing and they bo they were all sat on the middle lo middle of there with their feet dangling in the water splashing away, he said I was dragging this down and this six footer came out, I said, and then they were he said, you've never seen anybody run so fast in your life like they go'

Barry: 'they were dangling their toes at the end of this thing.
Yeah.'

Alan: 'Yeah.
Oh aye.'

Barry: 'And then, the next day I went along and he actually caught the five foot one and ki and killed it and he gave us a load of steaks off it that I sort of'

Alan: 'Baked?'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'The trouble was they were really bony, that's the only thing it was and I don't like eating'

Alan: 'Well'

Barry: 'fish and bo with bones in I can't stand it.'

Alan: 'well you can't fillet them can you?'

Barry: 'No.
No.'

Alan: 'Impossible.'

Barry: 'Impossible.
No.
Cos it's like a central spinal'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'and it's all off it so you'd be just you know, it's not like'

Alan: 'Normal flat'

Barry: 'a fish, a flat fish.
I mean, but it was really nice it was it was a really chewy meat you know.
But'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'like shark or something and er'

Alan: 'There's supposed to be decent congas off Beachy.'

Barry: 'Is there?'

Alan: 'You know the old'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'oil [UNK].'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Terri: 'It's me!'

Alan: 'Down there.'

Barry: 'Yeah.

Alan: 'Plenty of rocks under there.'

Barry: 'Yeah.

Alan: 'People say they've had some big ones.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'But, you know about the stories you hear.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'I've never actually seen one.'

Barry: 'No.
They're ugly looking fish aren't they?
Bloody horrible fish!
But er evil looking things.
This guy was great though we met in Ireland cos he was erm he used to own about three or four supermarkets, er small chains and he just one day, he's about he's about fifty eight, sixty now and one day he said about five years ago he just got fed up and just walked out.
All he does is fish all day long.
And he'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'just, he lives in somebody's basement of a house, and like, in return for living there he fills the guy's freezer up with lobster, crab, you know'

Alan: 'Mm mm.'

Barry: 'fish and that and erm everything he does in the village i in Kilrush is everything, he just you know, he wants a new pair of shoes, wants a coat brings'

Alan: 'Yes.'

Barry: 'a couple of lobster, you know, and things like tha cos like to him he, he's got his crab lines and his lobster pots all the time and all that.

Barry: 'I don't think they've got a lot of staff on.
I wouldn't have thought they'd bother with a'

Terri: 'Mm.'

Hugh: 'Does the Sugar House get that many people in?'

Barry: 'No.
No.
The Sugar House only opens er Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
Or, or, o we always have done.
I mean, we we opened originally, first year, every night of the bloody week and it was pointless, absolutely pointless.'

Hugh: 'Is that bigger than the Empire?

Barry: 'Er yeah.
Yes it is.'

Terri: 'Is it?'

Barry: 'It's legal, it's legal'

Hugh: 'No, twelve, twelve or thirteen.
They never had fifteen.'

Barry: 'Didn't they?
I mean the Sugar House, his capacity's'

Barry: 'just been upped to eleven hundred I think.
Erm I mean, it was always nine hundred, but it's been upped to eleven hundred last year I think.
Well we used to put, I mean, I put twelve, thirteen hundred in the Sugar House.
But tha but you it's full at that, you know.'

We'll nothing, we'll, won't be able to paint the floor and put the carpets down on'

[UNK]: 'I mean I'

Barry: 'that floor.'

[UNK]: 'I would have thought to be honest, I would have thought you don't need any of that area'

Barry: 'No.'

[UNK]: 'carpeted.'

Barry: 'Just to, probably, very ends of [UNK]'

Barry: 'Don't you, you want your raised area, this'

[UNK]: 'You want your two raised areas carpeted.'

Barry: 'Er, by, by the bar would you say it no not right in front'

Barry: 'you know, have that'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'running to about three foot back.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Yeah that'

Barry: 'Well'

Barry: 'but you don't really want it up to the bar if you're going to get'

Barry: 'No I'm saying that'

Barry: 'you go right up to the bar'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'you want it up to'

[UNK]: 'See if you put artists on and you have this area as some kind of without carpet on'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'in some ways, you haven't put, you can actually be, you know, dancing on this area.
I mean, tha that's the problem we got at the moment.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'On Mary's do, what we did, I put [UNK] soul machine over here where the screen was'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'so people could dance on the er on the actual dance floor if they wanted.
Erm I mean, it's not ideal but it really, it worked.
It wor even, providing you haven't got a lot of if you've only got about a hundred people it's not too bad that cos it, it also creates a bit more atmosphere.
But, it's a better i it's not a bad designed place in a sense that, that I mean, it's a reasonable size room'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'and you ca and three hundred people er, you can take three hundred quite'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'easily I mean, you know, we've had four, fives hundred in.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'You can take three hundred quite easily.
But the erm the other thing about it is if you have a hundred people in it can be so also be a good atmosphere, you know?'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'Yet, i it's not one of those rooms where, if'

Barry: 'No.'

[UNK]: 'you only get a hu yo you're struggling if you've only a got a hundred.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'Erm, what I'm, I've just arranged somebody to redo our speaker syste our original system with tannoys, we blew our tannoys speakers, and I didn't bother getting them replaced because we were going for a rock crowd so we just used Bernie and Nigel'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'P A there.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'What I've got, is I've got four of these directional speakers, there's two up and two on here and then two big bass ones which sit on a floor back there.
And, so it's very loud on the dance floor but you can actually talk out, out here.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'Which I thought we need to redo if we're gonna get private bookings.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'Cos the one thing you always get when you've got a mixture of people, I mean, all thi this needs recovering basically as well.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'But I mean, that's not a big job it's just'

Barry: 'No.'

[UNK]: 're relinoing it basically.'

Barry: 'Oh yeah. [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Oh yeah.'

Barry: '[UNK] Filling the smoke'

[UNK]: 'Smoke machine'

Barry: 'up.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, you got a smoke machine we, we, we would set in little, in a hole in the back.'

Barry: 'And all of these air conditioning valves are on?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'Actually I'm having the, a th I mean I can get, I'm getting our system back in operation.
It, it was gonna cost me a thousand but I've done a deal with a guy who'd got stuck with some in Manchester so it's gonna cost me five hundred which I'm getting done this Friday.
Erm to put a satellite system, to put a satellite in would be three hundred quid in total.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'So I mean it's that's only one that's only one good'un, good night using it innit, a year?
Pays for that.'

Barry: 'Yo you're light, the er ceiling could you not get away with covering the, get the lights a colour blue?
And er and you know, tidying up ceiling obviously [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Right.'

Barry: 'I mean, there's lots of bits and pieces you need for a'

Barry: 'I mean, if you just cover all the areas that were really'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'bad, er I reckon, I says, well what do you think yourself in, in, in'

[UNK]: 'Well the, the big the single biggest cost is, is what we do with this a carpet area.'

Barry: 'Mm. [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'That's our single biggest cost, cos as I say, I had three quotes in total, and they were all sort of between thirteen and twenty three.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Thousand.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.
But that's, having said that, that's to carpet all this area'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'that back area I've just taken you through, that, the staircase, and the corridors out there.
I mean, that's the carpet ev I just said like I wanted a quote to carpet'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'everywhere.
Erm what we were doing is, i what it was for, was for, for prospective buyers, they wanted erm a justification for'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'the money they were gonna spend.
I mean, they wouldn't have spent that money.
But, they wanted written quotes for a justification more or less.'

Barry: 'Do you think it's better being like this?
Looking there, or is it better sort of, clearing your floor and get a wider dancing space and'

[UNK]: 'Well it's quite, it's a reasonable size'

Barry: 'I know it's a fair size, but [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'It's a fair size dancing'

Barry: 'you know'

[UNK]: 'space actually, I mean, you get about a hundred people on here, it's, it's, it's alright.
In fact the, in fact it's, i at times it's too big.
That's, my one, I don't know how you'd ever get over it, but that's my one criticism of the thing is that sometimes when you walk in it's the first thing that hits you and unless people are dancing it creates a cold atmosphere.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'Erm'

Barry: 'I mean, if you've got your group on there's nothing better than having your floor there and are dancing on the floor at, at, in front of the group kind of thing like'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, but I mean a a if you have any'

[UNK]: 'anything like a, a, a group takes all of this.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'If you have a'

Barry: 'That's right.'

[UNK]: 'a main group up, you know'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'you're struggling to get'

Barry: 'But then if you did this floor space like'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'we said'

[UNK]: 'Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, I, I actually don't think you need carpet on I mean I, I don't'

Barry: 'Oh no.'

[UNK]: 'think, I don't think you need any of this carpet, to be honest.'

Barry: '[UNK] black [UNK], would that look nice?
Black [UNK] carpet.'

[UNK]: 'I dunno.'

Barry: 'Ah, cos Peter was saying, I dunno, I dunno what the black [UNK].'

Barry: 'Don't have to be black [UNK], you just want, you want something that er I don't know really, you'd have to think about it wouldn't you?'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Oh yeah.'

[UNK]: 'Could do with probably somebody who knows what they're doing on it.'

Barry: 'You want the carpet area full of seating'

Barry: 'Actually one thing Barry'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'don't you?'

[UNK]: 'That's right.'

Barry: 'Give it a bit of warmth when they're sitting right'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'down.
[UNK] the area.'

Barry: 'That's one thing Ben [UNK] said though, which was quite useful, he said get some people down pick their brains.'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'You know, let them come down and give a quote'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'for whatever you're looking at'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'and pick what they thought, was the best thing you could do, and then don't, don't tell you but get them made.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'You know, and like'

Barry: 'That's right.'

Barry: 'I say it, these guys are working on this all the time.'

[UNK]: 'I mean, on a normal night it's, the raised areas fill up with people seated.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'This area's er, everybody's stood around.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'I mean, i i it's a while before these chairs are, the they're always the last ones these to sit'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'down cos you're in the middle of the thoroughfare.
You know, i i you need to be full to fill up that area because well, you know yourself, people like to stand around the bar don't they?'

Barry: 'Mm.
Oh!
That's right, yeah.'

[UNK]: 'So, I mean, all you do is get, I mean this and this has been down well it's, obviously it's been down since it opened, now I can't remember when Brewer actually opened'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'but it must be seven years ago.
If we've been'

Barry: 'Nearly seven or eight year ago weren't'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'it?'

[UNK]: 'I mean we've been in three.'

Barry: 'Yeah, it'll be about eight, eight year ago.'

[UNK]: 'It was closed for a'

Barry: 'I wonder'

[UNK]: 'year.'

Barry: 'I wonder how ma [UNK] had to to town, I come down from across the town.'

[UNK]: 'I don't know.
It's getting the steam roller up that worries me.'

[UNK]: 'Well you'

Barry: 'the time after [UNK] don't it?'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'Well, I mean, I don't know how to find the other one out.'

Barry: 'You only have to paint the dance floor on then don't you?'

Barry: 'I wonder how much it would cost the town, like?
I know it sounds silly, but I say, the silly things like that are the ones that sometimes are the'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'ones that are took seriously.
But like you say, the floor can stand it and there's nice little corner or whatever int there?'

Barry: 'I don't know.'

Barry: 'That was rather a cheekiest thing to do.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'I mean, a er a, you see ou a good, a good looking, hard wearing wo lino'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'might not'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'go amiss.
Cos then you can just, just mop it down, brush it or whatever, you don't even'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'need to bother vacuuming, which takes time, is a pain in the neck and you can never get a vacuum that's any good anyway.
And plugs.'

Barry: '[UNK] they might look er you know they look cheapy or'

[UNK]: 'No.'

Barry: '[UNK] sort of'

[UNK]: 'But you'

Barry: 'lino being'

[UNK]: 'No, they do, but you can get good ones now can't you?'

Barry: 'Ah yeah!'

[UNK]: 'I mean, you can get ones that look like I just wonder whether you can get ones that look like sort of parquet floors almost?'

Barry: 'I've seen [UNK] these industrial companies and he said look, have you got any er of your older stuff'

Barry: 'What's that?
Because Polly's got a [UNK] it was at the front of the bar, it's quite a heavy duty thing int it that?'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'It'll take fag burns and, you want something that's not gonna that's like, that's got li like that crystaley stuff'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'you'

Barry: 'It's a non-slip stuff.'

[UNK]: 'want, but I would have thought that'll be quite dear won't it?
You know, that kind [UNK] with all the grit'

Barry: 'Yeah I know.
I like that.'

[UNK]: 'in it [UNK].'

Barry: 'I wonder if you went to the industrial companies, and said look, have you got a a, a, a big lot of something and'

Barry: 'Yeah, well that'll be alright.'

Barry: 'You know.'

[UNK]: 'Well do, ja er, I mean er is it Marnes do that floor covering?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah but that was for carpets, was it, i is, is, is that, do they do the floor coverings there?'

Barry: 'Yeah, all that sort of thing.
What's the ladies like?'

[UNK]: 'The ladies are alright.
Yeah, they're alright.
Don't need, I mean if we get somebody in to do that, we'd have somebody in do little bits of repairs here and there, but generally it's alright.
I'll show you [UNK].
See, there's a tremendous amount of wasted space there!'

Barry: 'Mm.
And Jean's corridor.'

[UNK]: 'Jean's corridor.'

Barry: 'I resume, see if the places are [UNK].'

[UNK]: 'It, and we had ninety on it on Saturday.

And then cos you're not supposed to stand up upstairs.'

Barry: 'See the crack int bog.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'I think it's got a bit damaged on Saturday, then he put him back'

Barry: 'Supposed to lift base.

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Aye.'

[UNK]: 'The trouble is, toilets are toilets and they don't and they'

Barry: 'Oh aye.'

Barry: 'That's nice, in the toilet.'

Barry: 'Yeah, take them in.'

Barry: 'That's right mate.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'leaking roof.
Cos these bloody tiles are expensive!'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Yeah, but I mean you know, at the moment we've not been pushing anything till'

Barry: 'No.'

[UNK]: 'I mean, everything's sorted out, then I will.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'cos a they're open and the wind drives under it.'

Barry: 'Well it and shut up to there with [UNK] and that you can'

[UNK]: 'Ah yeah.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'this off.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.

Barry: 'So they've nothing better to do.
You got them on trough, then they're saying alright we'll do it somewhere else.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'And the environmental health guy there and all.'

Barry: 'Well they probably thought you wrote it [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Yeah!'

Barry: 'Looks like they're not getting on.'

[UNK]: 'This was a good idea of Johnny's which they did, which [UNK] did before was this corridor, these lights up here that one when it's re-doing, but there's one, two, three, four, five, six and they framed a large advertising poster.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'And so, like hundred quid a year'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'for'

Barry: 'Yeah!'

Barry: 'For putting it'

Barry: 'It could be a'

Barry: 'out.'

[UNK]: 'I mean it's six hundred quid for doing nothing innit?'

Barry: 'That's right.'

Barry: 'Six is it?
Oh.'

[UNK]: 'Erm, you know er, I can't remember who they are, but it wasn't clientele, but I mean we could, you know we could'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'look around for.. the relevant er'

Barry: 'That's right.'

Barry: 'And how much of this stuff's down?
I mean, this'll have been down I, oh, won't be able to get as much wear [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.
This is, this is, this is'

[UNK]: 'original as far as I know.'

Barry: 'Did you lay that yourself?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'A little bit [UNK]'

Barry: 'Do they just seem to stick on tap or is it a row?'

[UNK]: 'No, no, no this is a row.'

Barry: 'A row.
Yeah.'

Barry: 'The stuff that's [UNK] that's the stuff you want.'

Barry: 'This is, it is not the similar stuff like we've got in the kitchen upstairs?'

Barry: 'No.'

Barry: 'No.'

[UNK]: 'That rug stuff.'

Barry: 'It is er, it's er'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'a actually it is like that stuff.
But it's different.'

Barry: 'It wasn't here was it?
Same'

Barry: 'No.'

Barry: 'sort of thing.'

Barry: 'No.'

Barry: 'Maybe that's the type of thing you want on the floor.'

Barry: 'I reckon that is.
That is it.'

[UNK]: 'In there.
Make, do some more er extend the er er er er parquet flooring area to give you more dance room.
An and, and round the other areas which'

Barry: 'Up here.'

[UNK]: 'and keep the carpet on the high seating areas.'

Barry: 'Oh aye.
Yeah.
I think it's better up there.'

[UNK]: 'Oh yeah.
Aye, but it wouldn't cost very much to carpet those two areas.'

Barry: 'No.'

[UNK]: 'I think you do, you know, do something'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'a little bit better, but I mean'

[UNK]: 'but it, you just need something that's ro that's hardwearing and'

Barry: 'And practical really, isn't it?'

[UNK]: 'you know.'

Barry: 'As I say, people aren't going in in there to look at, oh! what a pretty carpet you've got.'

[UNK]: 'No.'

Barry: 'Oh no!'

Barry: 'As long as it's, as long as it, it's warm'

[UNK]: 'Well if you remember most of the time the lights are off.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'It's only to create an impression when you're doing it in the day time.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
That's right.'

[UNK]: 'I mean, I don't know whether you've thought any more about that idea that Colin had, but, I mean, I don't know, yo cos you haven't said you do, you haven't really looked round it.'

Barry: 'No, that's right, you know, the, the, the only thing we've, we've actually gonna trying to get that into a the bar is er [UNK] segregate'

[UNK]: 'Perhaps er Jean's left actually [UNK].'

[UNK]: 'This is this was the, the cloakroom and what we were what we were intending doing originally'

[UNK]: 'is turn it into an office.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'I mean, we haven't done so far but we, that's what but, this is stuff we got about hundred'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.'

[UNK]: 'and fifty quid for two massive rolls like this.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'Well that's, well that's what not ba bad is it for those int'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'it?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.
I mean that's what Jean's talking about getting.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'That's alright int it?'

Barry: 'Oh to but that will fit is a bit'

[UNK]: 'Well er'

Barry: 'bit more thickness than I hoped, er but if it's sat on top of there and on top of what's on.'

[UNK]: 'On top of what's on?
Right.'

Barry: 'I don't know whether they were actually sitting right where the bevel or whatever.
I know this sort of stuff is we had similar to when I worked in the shop er, used to, he had three quarters of this, guy come round in a van or whatever, back of a van'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'and he laid it himself.'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Barry: '[UNK] and by the entrance and whatever er'

Barry: 'I think you'd have to get a professional carpet'

Barry: 'So'

Barry: 'layer just, just to make certain.'

Barry: 'Summat like that really, is, is obviously'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'And it's just stuck on int it?'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'I mean i er I, I spent as I say'

[UNK]: 'spent the best part of the year working in here, sort of nine to five type thing and it's mind walking down that bottom end without any ar without any natural light.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'That little office, you know, so I said to Jean, you know, well let's turn this into an office'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'basically.

Or did you [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'No.

Erm but I mean there are, there are other areas you can use.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'And you can use you could use past that erm cos that's the other thing I haven't shown you, is, is this is all ours as well down the bottom end.
Erm and that's the other thing about having having, sort of, a lot of people thinking it having, having it as a sort of rock club at night they, they regard it as their own, sort of thing'

Barry: 'Oh right.'

[UNK]: 'I mean, so when we do have to do redecoration we just gotta let the volunteers in.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'Left a, a crate of Pils for them and carry on painting everything.
Right this is er that's the snooker next door'

Barry: 'Next door.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.

Barry: '[UNK] Yeah I know, but it's, it's, it's summat [UNK]'

Barry: 'Aye.'

[UNK]: 'Right.

Barry: 'So the easiest thing really is obviously is if I get the thing sorted out and then, turn it'

[UNK]: 'Yep.'

Barry: 'around and er we've had a word with Elliel this morning.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Erm they they're quite happy with with all that sort of stuff.'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'and then you really should [UNK] with the staff we've'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'got.
So'

Barry: 'Make [UNK] by five'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'o'clock.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Five o'clock.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'I think the biggest thing really is just like they say, is how much you can get that done for [UNK] and, get the roofing done, that's gotta be done.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Er'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'some paper them toilets cos er, I'm, you know, I say, from our our, both side is something that's er I mean, everybody's looking purely from [UNK] and return sales.
All you're looking at is for an income [UNK], an income from it and er I reckon can do very well.'

Barry: 'What do you, what you think of that bar area Barry?
Do you think it could be inclined to be'

Barry: 'Er, the top one?'

Barry: 'as a drinking area'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'U yeah, I mean I'

Barry: 'during the day?'

Barry: 'yeah, well it was it was what I wanted to, it was what I wanted to, it was wanted to do initially, I mean, but then you have like so many ideas that'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'you know, you can't do them all in that sense, but if you had somebody somebody like Colin might be able to'

[UNK]: 'Cos you only need, you only need him to drag sort of fifteen, twenty people in initially'

Barry: 'And five, ten of them'

Barry: 'And they'll all, they'll all be drinkers.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.
But I mean sa ta so there's an at little atmosphere there anyway'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'erm and then you can, I mean, well it gives you the opportunity to, you know bang in a bloody jazz band or whatever you wanna do in there somewhere'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'and, and build it up like that.'

Barry: 'As you said, they haven't actually, you know, it'd be if you could get some sort of portable'

[UNK]: 'Screening.'

Barry: 'screen that'd just shut it off.'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'So people don't feel as though they're sat in a wide ai wide open'

[UNK]: 'No, I know, yeah.
Yeah, that's right.'

Barry: 'you know.
Erm'

[UNK]: 'Well you ca you ca you can get that.'

Barry: 'You can get, you can do something'

[UNK]: 'But, yeah'

Barry: 'can't you?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Like you say, if you get your satellite T V in there'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'you know, you can'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'just make it a cosy little bar where you can'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.
That's right.'

Barry: 'It won't cost any to give it a go would it?'

Barry: 'No.
If Colin's if Colin's up for it, it wouldn't at all.
I mean, it needs to perhaps perhaps they can do something for the first couple'

Barry: 'Oh yeah, need some sort of er'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'idea to get it going and get it off the ground even if you you put your beer on at, well I just thought of couple [UNK] Boddingtons put their they're they're gonna put their, they're gonna put there's at a pound a pint.'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'You know, just to attract some people, you know, approach the brewery, say look what about a few keg?
And if you get two or three keg put that money into free stock you know.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Say you [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Cleaner's not, the cleaner's not done behind here yet.'

Barry: 'If you open it up, if you do get it open, and advertise it at Boddingtons a pound a pint, get them straight to come in.
You're not making a fortune at first, but once you get it going'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'You said about traditional'

Barry: 'The only other thing is the [UNK].'

Barry: 'Depends where your money is really.'

Barry: 'Whe whe where's your cellar?'

[UNK]: 'Right underneath.
Right at the bottom.'

Barry: 'Yeah, but if, if you'

Barry: 'How big's your fire exit, entrance?'

Barry: '[UNK] the fire exit [UNK]'

Barry: 'You could put it behind, you could feed it through the wall behind to where that'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'spacious room is where all your chairs are couldn't you?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.
We probably could, yeah.
Th well, it's no, it's not quite the back.'

Barry: '[UNK] how would you get in there?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, that's the, that's the thing I was'

Barry: 'Well, it's got, it's a bit dry this.'

[UNK]: 'I know.
It's a bloody, yeah.'

Barry: 'You can still [UNK]. [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'It's fucking ridiculous!'

Barry: 'Erm cos you'd tell the brewery wouldn't you?'

Barry: 'The only other thing to do is, is do what er er, we did at one time and just get a bright beer and open it up and er, and then pull it.
And have it.'

Barry: 'I know.'

Barry: 'Now there's a thought.'

[UNK]: 'It er, you'd have problem with er'

Barry: 'But would you?'

[UNK]: 'Depends tha I don't know what sort of draw you can put on that pump here.
They're getting smart.'

Barry: 'But I wanna do what the Three Miners do in Lancaster don't they?'

Barry: 'That's that er that's a traditional beer innit? [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.
That's right, yeah.'

Barry: '[UNK] they gotta [UNK] but he's knocking it straight'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'down aren't they?'

Barry: 'It's just getting it up here.'

Barry: 'Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah, very strong lad this.'

Barry: 'You might have to do it later.'

[UNK]: 'Can I look at the telly?'

Barry: 'Yeah, course you can.
I was gonna'

Barry: 'It's in here.'

Barry: 'suggest that.'

Barry: 'Up here and then get [UNK].'

Barry: 'Oh, oh that's my order for Thursday.'

[UNK]: 'Oh right.'

Barry: 'Have you got line cleaner?
Yeah?'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'Yeah?'

Barry: 'That's put a [UNK].'

[UNK]: 'A fair, int it doing?'

Barry: 'The bar, the bar, on the bar.'

Barry: 'The bar's there, I mean I was thinking you had your stool, painted that white on'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'or a red a deep'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.'

Barry: 'sort of red behind the bar, maybe get a couple more like that.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, a lick of paint and, and'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.'

[UNK]: 'and, and that, you know and you can'

Barry: 'And then we'll fill the shelves up.'

Barry: 'That's right.'

[UNK]: 'All, all, one thing we haven't discussed is, is these ar these arrears int it, that we've got?
This, the rates'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'is the biggest one int it?'

Barry: 'Right.
Right.'

[UNK]: 'Now, I don't know if it's worth asking'

Barry: 'Well I could'

[UNK]: 'council to, if you could like lump it with the next year 's.'

Barry: 'El e Elliel, Elliel said that er they could probably twist the council's arm'

Barry: 'What's that for Barry?'

[UNK]: 'Well, this, you know we're on about this money'

Barry: 'Yes.'

[UNK]: 'well, there is, there is ba bad debts, you know which er'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'I don't know if I've got them here.'

Barry: 'How much is that for?'

[UNK]: 'Well it was er it was about'

Barry: 'Twenty two.'

[UNK]: 'here we are, that's it er it's rent which we we're gonna clear'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'there's twelve for rates, and the twelve and, other two's ours which we're we'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'can, we can stand on that.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'You've got, you've got like water rate, twelve hundred, er, rates, twelve but er, what we could try to do is approach them and see if we can lump it in with this year and that, obviously have to pay higher'

Barry: 'I mean, some of it is is the next two month anyway erm'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.
But we we'd usually have no'

Barry: 'but'

[UNK]: 'rents, er we've no er we've lease to pay back have we or owt like that?'

Barry: 'Oh and the other the other thing is, is, is by asking Fred for'

Barry: 'To pay.'

Barry: 'That's right.'

[UNK]: 'But even so, then ask Fred on the long term would be ideal.
Er, the biggest thing is for us is is making payable for you.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
I mean'

[UNK]: 'At first'

Barry: 'we've not gone any further with this Fre with Fred because'

Barry: 'No.'

Barry: 'we're just leaving it so we sort ourselves out first on, on how'

Barry: 'Yes.'

Barry: 'we feel happy with it and'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'and whe how, how, whether you want Fred involved in, in what way.'

[UNK]: 'Well it's really that's needed be here, you know, if we ca'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'if we can'

Barry: 'And'

[UNK]: 'if we can resolve it with cos then you're getting summat on a different style of thinking to that, you know, I know Fred doesn't wanna be involved but then you've always got somebody, well we'll have to go and see Fred first.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'And, and I don't know.'

Barry: 'Yeah, you could work it'

[UNK]: 'Go see Fred and he's probably got a few more pounds ready available than'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'than we have.'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.'

[UNK]: 'You know, that's the er'

Barry: 'That's right.'

[UNK]: 'bit difficult.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'And that's your er, cos er personally'

Barry: 'Oh, I've got the'

[UNK]: 'I'll say that it's not.'

Barry: 'accounts in various off-shore islands and, and'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'black bin liners in his back garden.'

[UNK]: 'If we can sort him out with rates and, I don't know.'

Barry: 'If he can o if we can offset, if we can use all, if he'll [UNK] out time type of thing'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'with that'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'erm the oh er'

[UNK]: 'You've gotta put an offer in and pay it so much a month haven't you or something and, and, and get it paid off over a period of time?'

Barry: 'And then you can do it without Fred and, really, with Fred is, is at the end of day you could pro proof pay load could go back to yourself and I, I E and ourselves, but by having him that other cut you're gonna be saying well it's all a bit more than your share.
I mean, from my point of view I don't think he's ever'

Barry: 'I don't think Fred'd be looking for anything as a return.'

[UNK]: 'No.'

Barry: 'Not in the shor'

Barry: 'I'd be quite happy to come'

Barry: 'not in the short term.
Not in the short term.'

Barry: 'you get tucked into it, and obviously there we'll keep it sort of low profile.
But giving it a good clean out and getting'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'it dus painted behind the things whatever, come on Sunday or whatever and just say that you might'

Barry: 'In return, yeah.
Just take a'

Barry: 'quite keen just to sort of get'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'mucked into it'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'just to save money'

[UNK]: 'See if you can get'

Barry: 'but as long as, I say, the biggest thing from my point er is not to so lose money if you can do from where we're going.'

Barry: 'No.'

Barry: 'And use the fifteen grand to its best image in the way that you feel then you can turn round and run a club so it can get people in.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'And we can get the lighting in.
Because that's what your best thing is'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'you've got the ideas and th the motions.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'And for yourself, and what we don't wanna do is like I say, is spend money that is just gonna disappear and say shit!
We haven't really improved the pub's barrelage if goes away.'

Barry: 'No.
I mean, th the other aspect of the, of the fif the other aspect of the, the brewery and me that I was talking about, er I'm thinking about is that we we could do with you know, okay those, th those figures are I mean, unless they're really realistic it's gonna be you know, six months or so'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'before we start getting up to the kind of figures where we can actually see a you know'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'a profit each week'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'a a, a, reasonably substantial profit, I mean'

[UNK]: 'That's right, yeah.'

Barry: 'so, with the best will in the world it's going to be six months so let's so we need a little of breathing space'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'on that six months.
Now er, er obviously if, if we can, if we can get the money off the brewery cos you know, if we can get a little bit more'

Barry: 'That's right, yes.'

Barry: 'than we actually need to spend that that'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'enables us to you know, have that breathing space erm so we can start'

Barry: 'Well what, what we can, you know I say, he's offering us this fifteen unsecured if we can, mind you'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'I don't know if we can squeeze any more or what'

[UNK]: 'I reckon'

Barry: 'but, but, you know if say well look, you know, we could do with twenty five and he turns round and [UNK] he might say well you know, yo he might say no'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'but we know we've got fifteen just to get us'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'going.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.'

Barry: 'What he said then is look, you know hey he's, all you're saying really'

Barry: 'is ah, if your barrelage is there then what we do is buy five or six barrels from Morecambe Bay Wines.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'You can soon get rid of those.'

Barry: 'You can say Morecambe Bay Wines and buy all his'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'cos what I, I just said to him I said look, I says a er sometimes I says it's an awkward time drop for us.
Says well we'll get it delivered here you know, only without'

Barry: 'Yeah well that's'

Barry: 'invoice.'

Barry: 'That's what we wanted innit?'

Barry: 'Well what we do, what we use'

[UNK]: 'What we do is buy it barrelled and and'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'get out be'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'Morecambe Bay License form.'

Barry: 'Barrel or keg.'

[UNK]: 'Because we ca we can live on thirty pound on barrel [UNK] can't we?
I think we can do.'

Barry: 'I'd like you to just purely myself, I'm not saying I'm right and you're not right and people like'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'my o my own personal view is if we just pay the fifteen and it's sort of off in there straight away and then spend but not to sort of say, well you can spend it and update it can't you?
But spend what we feel is gonna make the club'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'better image like you say'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'somebody comes to look at it just for a view I mean, I say, I, I'm quite happy coming like I said th if you motion behind there, make the bar presentable we'll fill it out with stock then that'll look better'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'but if we do display'

[UNK]: 'Put more stock in.'

Barry: 'we've got a load'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'of tent cards and display things'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'that could decorate that.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'You know, and we'll do it ourselves, I say I mean, what you want Barry is like wanna keep it low profile.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'But we've both got time to sort, I say, somebody, we'd enjoy doing it.
Because we, we, we either do it ourselves and spend'

Barry: 'Before the cricket season.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

Barry: 'I mean, America are getting a private cup for here.'

Barry: 'I mean, if you just emulsion'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'that, the red bits, into red and got the, so I say, nice sort of tent cards and and got a few firms, I mean firms and come on in and do your display you know'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'and your promotions and'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'That's something we will, we will be able to do is, you know, is'

Barry: 'Yeah.
I mean things like what I want on desperately quickly is Rebel Yell cos they're spending a fortune in the rock, well all our punters all know it.
I mean you go down in London it's the it's just like Rebel Yell everywhere, but it's all heavy rock so'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'I mean it's just perfect for that, but I know they do a display unit and things like'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'that.
But I mean, I have to go'

Barry: 'Well that's all it wants.'

Barry: 'through, I have to go through Michelin to get that.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'o'clock?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'It destroyed all that.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'And then er, they brought it back and then they started doing to quarter to six, but it still wasn't good enough cos you can't, you can't have all these people in suits and briefcases stood outside a pub for quarter of an hour waiting for it open, you know'

You know, because they're the few main things round here, you're happy, and you can feel that obviously you, you'll be working for something.'

Barry: 'Yeah.

Barry: 'and, you're losing money, [UNK], if you're not, if you're not seeing any return you're'

[UNK]: 'No.'

Barry: 'you're going through the motions'

[UNK]: 'No.'

Barry: 'I mean, God, you know if I've gotta go down to London for three days I'd rather do that cos it's gonna earn me two or three grand.'

Barry: 'Well we could set, like you say and no you know, and get it going and you make a salary'

[UNK]: 'and, and then if there's anything left e er, between us, and then that's all well'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'and good.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'We're, we're not wanting a wage out of it or anything, you know'

[UNK]: 'We we're, we're quite, we're quite pleased, you know, say well let's see if we can get it going and, and make a success out of it.'

Barry: 'And also, I mean, if we turn over hundred thousand pound with you in a year you're gonna make some money out of that.'

Barry: 'That's right.
Yeah.
You know, so it's'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'er'

Barry: 'Make a grand or summat out of that won't you?'

[UNK]: 'That's it, yeah.'

[UNK]: 'If we're lucky.'

Barry: 'If you're lucky.'

[UNK]: 'The only th the only thing is, is th is what we'll do the beer, whether we're gonna have to connect it to the brewery or whether we can get it through ourselves, I don't know.
I would think you're probably gonna have, committed to separate accounts.'

Barry: 'Yeah, I'm not too bothered about that.'

[UNK]: 'But as I said'

Barry: 'But if it's, if it can be dropped at your place'

[UNK]: 'Well that's it, yeah.'

Barry: 'Because I mean er you can always say look, I've got commitments all over the place and actually be'

Barry: 'Well that'

[UNK]: 'it doesn't, it doesn't matter what barrelage you put through it but put, as long as we know that er, the fifteen thou it's gonna be written off at thirty pound a barrel, so the sooner you, you do it, the sooner it's written off.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
But also'

Barry: 'Good.'

## 064102

[UNK]: 'I'll just have a look round there again Barry.'

Barry: 'Yeah okay.
Do you wanna'

[UNK]: 'Can I see the back?'

Barry: 'play with those figures again?'

Barry: 'Dunno.'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.
Okay.
[UNK] gonna have a look round the back is he?'

Barry: 'Yeah.

Barry: 'Oh ta.'

Barry: '[UNK] you're gonna be really talking about next week aren't you?'

Barry: 'It looks like it.'

Barry: 'Yeah if you can.
Definitely.'

Barry: 'See not that easy.'

[UNK]: 'No.
I'm just thinking of that exit there.
This, this is good.
I mean if you put that'

[UNK]: 'the nearest one'

Barry: 'You mean, it's a fire exit so that's the problem so you're not gonna be able to leave anything in it that would obstruct.'

[UNK]: 'But ah, so this, it's the actual fire exit for here int'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'it?
Yeah.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'That leads downstairs don't it?'

Barry: 'Yeah.
It goes out next to the cellar.'

[UNK]: 'I suppose like you say at nine thirty once the music starts no one's gonna want to'

Barry: 'Oh er, if you put, if you put if you put wrought iron gates [UNK] gates decorated type of thing round there'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'and then somebody stands there, two fifty that's what I were thinking, an admission from here.'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'And, and wrought iron it, yeah, you know.'

Barry: 'Well wrought iron'd look it'd look quite good for the functions trade as well cos you can get'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'the artificial plants up it'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'and whatever else'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'when you do'

Barry: 'Get [UNK] climbing plants'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'You can get it, it will soon cover'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'cover it actually.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'I mean close that area down.'

Barry: 'And that, that would do double job cos that would do the job of your blinds as well wouldn't it?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.
Yeah.
And then they'll cause the atmosphere rather than'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'big open wide'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'club.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'Get your wrought, your gates there, or something like that to be'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'round the back, which entrance would they come in?
They wouldn't come in that end. [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Well all you do right, you have gates'

Barry: 'Well I mean'

[UNK]: 'then they're open so that at half nine you close them there, or at ten o'clock you close them there and you say when they come through if you're going out that'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'way or whatever.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
I mean I I think you just have to but'

[UNK]: 'It's something that you've gotta be'

Barry: 'You'd have to play it by ear I think.
Yes'

[UNK]: 'thinking ahead.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'You know, you're thinking well'

Barry: 'Let's'

[UNK]: 'at first you could just wrought iron it round and, and just give it that'

Barry: 'As you say, if somebody's been in there from bloody five o'clock and wants to stay till eleven'

[UNK]: 'Well that's it.'

Barry: 'or twelve, then fine, let them.
I mean I th I wouldn't, I wouldn't mind that'

[UNK]: 'No.'

Barry: 'you know, I mean'

Barry: 'So you could either come in half eight, half nine or [UNK]'

Barry: 'That's right.
You know'

[UNK]: 'But really, you know'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'what you do?
At half nine you put someone on the door here to take money, anyone who comes in, whether they come into here or go into there'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'anyone who's been drinking all afternoon if you want to er, wander across'

Barry: 'Yeah, I mean, what you, what you'd have to be careful of is, is sooner or later people'll catch on to'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'coming in at quarter past nine'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

Barry: 'buying one extra drink and erm getting a you know cheaper than saving theirselves two and a half quid then.'

Barry: '[UNK] pint they buy, and if they buy five pints'

Barry: 'Yeah!'

Barry: 'they can have a three, er er a three pound voucher.'

[UNK]: 'Can you imagine Polly organizing that all!'

Barry: 'We're getting complicated aren't we?'

[UNK]: 'Why can't we do it, to me, cost effective.'

[UNK]: 'Torture.'

Barry: 'Complicating issues.'

Barry: 'I remember at the Uni when we used to give we used to put stamps on people, you know,'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'for pass outs and that or anything'

[UNK]: 'So does Broadway.'

Barry: 'and er I bloody, I said, I said in the end I've, what we ought to do is lop some part of their anatomy off, like a little digit or something then we can prove they've been in'

Barry: 'eventually, after about two years when you get this sort of armless, legless cor'

[UNK]: 'Oh oh!'

Barry: 'body oh he's a good customer!
We'll let him in for free!
He gets a free, free ticket!'

Barry: 'Well it's like, like a all you want to do is [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'That's what you get, [UNK] you just gotta stand or you went downstairs to another bar'

Barry: 'Yeah, th the trouble is you're'

[UNK]: 'and got a stamp'

Barry: 'you'

[UNK]: 'and they would'

Barry: 'you, you're doing it in the same room'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'aren't you?
That's the [UNK].'

[UNK]: 'That is as well.'

Barry: 'But I I dunno, I see it's not once you're u actually up here, looking I think it's different when you're up here looking back as when you're over there looking up here.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'It's not quite as cold and empty as'

[UNK]: 'If it got going you'd probably use mo another, another half of area, you know'

Barry: 'Yeah, yeah, you want'

[UNK]: 'you don't wanna close it off.
But, like you say maybe just just a bit of wrought'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'ironwork'

Barry: 'Yeah.
I think so.'

[UNK]: 'to just'

Barry: 'I think you do I think that would look good anyway and'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'and it would also enable you to quickly and easily do something on the erm on the, on the private functions night to make it look different.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'I mean, I wouldn't suggest putting'

Barry: 'plants up and everything for our normal you know, rock nights, I mean we just have the wrought iron up and whatever, but'

[UNK]: 'I mean, with them sort of then'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'once you got erm tied into these you can'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.'

[UNK]: 'do whatever to the thing.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'But it would give you affect.'

Barry: 'That's right.
I mean, those are just we just went out and chucked a few fucking trees down.'

[UNK]: 'They're not real then Barry?'

Barry: 'No, the trees are the er things tied on to them aren't.'

[UNK]: 'Oh.'

Barry: 'But er'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.
I think, it's quite actually, it needs a bit of character.'

Barry: 'I mean, that'll cover'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'if you did that in quite a few places'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'throughout the room it would cover your cracks and your holes'

Barry: 'Ye'

Barry: 'and your, your [UNK].'

Barry: 'I mean, what we initially wanted to do with all this was cover this whole area in, in greenery and have this as a sort of restaurant ta type.'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'I mean, again, it's ideas when you're sat'

Barry: 'It's ideas.'

Barry: 'planning, before you've actually moved in and get'

Barry: 'It is.
Yeah, yeah, that's right.'

Barry: 'and get and then, then you start'

Barry: 'that's, that's the other thing when there's only two of you involved and you, we were opening for that first sort of eighteen months five, six days a week just keeping on top of a day to day business doesn't allow you to sit back'

[UNK]: 'No, I know that.'

Barry: 'and expand it, and whereas, you know, that, that's one area that'd be great with having yo your involvement'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'that you go in and say well you know'

Barry: 'It sounds like this sort of thing'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'When did you paint all this green?'

Barry: 'It was when I was working for Walt Disney, so it'll be two years ago.
Two years'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'ago.
I was over in Belfast and I came back and it were green.
It was alri it's, it's actually lasted reasonably well considering it hadn't been'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'for two years.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'But again, it was all done, it was all literally done in a weekend.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'It was like a virtually an all night blitz job and so bits of it, you know, it wasn't like, totally completed, you know, you've got and as Scouse was doing some of it it was er the paintwork leaves something to be desired in areas.'

[UNK]: 'Something there Barry little bit in there look.'

Barry: 'Just coming down a little bit.
They just need brushing back up.'

[UNK]: 'It's got a few you've got the'

Barry: 'Not a problem.'

[UNK]: 'roof repaired haven't you?
This'

Barry: 'Yeah.
The heating's very efficient as well.
It's very hot gas heating.'

Barry: 'Yes.'

Barry: 'Erm'

Barry: 'They did do it, like you say it was more or less just covering for itself now and then use'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'you build up, up and up don't you?'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'So'

Barry: 'Yes.'

[UNK]: 'Let us have a look at cellar and then we'll, d'ya wanna, and then we'll,'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'then we can say we've to looked at everything and then we know where you know'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Okay.'

[UNK]: 'and then we can er we can start, you know, we can, at least we can say look, we've got fifteen grand coming in and th it [UNK].'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'But we need a full [UNK].'

Barry: 'Yeah.
I mean, we can, we can start by we I mean we can get people set up for doing things from the first of March can't we?'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'The little bits and pieces that we talked about.'

Barry: 'Well we, well we, we can start if you wanna start with the'

Barry: 'Or we can think about doing something about'

[UNK]: 'Yes.'

Barry: 'this.'

Barry: 'We can start giving it a lick of paint if you wanna start giving it a lick of paint.'

Barry: 'You see, now the more you think about it, I mean the more you you don't actually use this'

[UNK]: 'No.'

Barry: 'very much.
I mean, you look at it, if everybody was seated in this area that could be seated I mean, you're only talking about bloody'

Barry: 'I'

Barry: 'thirty people.'

Barry: 'I don't think it's too bad actually.
I don't think the carpet's too bad at all really.'

Barry: 'Well th there's areas, I mean'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'tha the licens'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.'

Barry: 'the licensing people would pull us up on that'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'if they came.'

[UNK]: 'But maybe, if you could cut it off from there.'

Barry: 'That's what I mean, you gotta and then do it, clear it, and then clear all that'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'and just left that area'

[UNK]: 'Clear all that'

Barry: 'and they're obviously, they're gonna say'

[UNK]: 'Come right up to the right up to bar really aren't you?'

Barry: 'Yeah.
I mean th th er, the other thing psychologically is it's, you know'

Barry: 'Blue Rhapsody.'

Barry: 'Blue Rhapsody.
If you wanted to cha if you want to change it slightly you've got a problem.'

[UNK]: 'You know I think it, I think it's something that you can say well you know, that'd be one of our objectives'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'once we get it going, but le'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'alright, we we've got'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'a few bob in the kitty'

Barry: 'Right.'

[UNK]: 'let's, or we can go to brewery for another five grand, we'll do the carpet'

Barry: 'Mm.'

[UNK]: 'now.'

Barry: 'I reckon the first thing really is, is get your salary.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'Get your salary, that you feel that I'm doing this and I'm getting it right.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'Is that the right sort of, if our I mean from our objective is to get more sales'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'right now.'

Barry: 'That's right.
That's right.'

Barry: 'And we've gotta'

Barry: 'That's right.'

Barry: 'manipulate people to say well, how do we get them drink more?
And you say like five pound a head when they they come in'

[UNK]: 'How bad's the seating though?'

Barry: 'Sit there till'

[UNK]: 'Is it, is it that bad?'

Barry: 'It's, it's, if, it needs doing'

[UNK]: 'Oh it needs doing does it?'

Barry: 'You know.'

Barry: 'If you've got a guy gathered, I'm not saying try but if you got somebody who, who did the job and gathered it in like they would do.'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it i'

Barry: 'An upholster.'

Barry: 'It's a perpetual patching up job at the moment'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

Barry: 'Because, because it is only patched up, it's'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'it create more problems o you know cos people stand on it and'

Barry: 'Get an upholsterer just to come and tidy it up'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'and fill in where there's been'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'some damage done.'

Barry: 'Yeah, that's right.
I mean there's'

Barry: 'Just, just tart it up really.'

Barry: 'There's a bit of structural damage to the support'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'and things like that, that start the seating going and things.'

[UNK]: 'Right.
Okay.'

Barry: 'Oh this this actual stuff anyway we'll go, we're putting that with that is alright to that'

Barry: 'Oh yes.'

Barry: 'the back's have been'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'alright.'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.'

Barry: 'There's a few of them damaged but, but erm I think we've repaired most of them.
You see, we did get it all completely repaired when we moved in, cos it was in a hell of a state from Peter [UNK]!
Cos Peter [UNK] had this place.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
That's right.'

[UNK]: 'Well we, we, we know'

Barry: 'We knew'

[UNK]: 'about that.'

Barry: 'about that.'

Barry: 'How?
Did he'

[UNK]: 'Cos we'

Barry: 'owe you money?'

[UNK]: 'we gone'

Barry: 'Well'

[UNK]: 'and got it actually.'

Barry: 'Did you!'

[UNK]: 'Bloody right!'

Barry: 'God!
You must be one of the few people'

[UNK]: 'It were quite good cos what we had, we had th the the other partner who was, you know, the other partner is Michael.'

Barry: 'He was called, what was he called?
Ken [UNK]?'

Barry: 'No, no.'

[UNK]: 'No.'

Barry: 'No, that's'

[UNK]: 'Yes.'

Barry: 'that's John [UNK].'

Barry: 'But what do you call him?
That erm'

Barry: 'I know who you mean, I met him, yeah.'

Barry: 'Cos the other guy was a, was a bar manager Duncan or'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'Der summat like that, and his wife had a baby at the same time as Elaine's so she our midwife would come and er, so the she kept in touch really of of what they were [UNK] because they wanted to, I'll take the place off [UNK], they wanted to take it over.
I don't think they was er as bad a'

Barry: 'No.'

Barry: 'shower of shit'

Barry: 'No.'

Barry: 'as he were'

Barry: 'No.'

Barry: 'tended to'

Barry: 'No.'

Barry: 'be.
But er, in the end they never got the license back.
Because what they did try and do is buy the catholic club didn't they?
Top of Lancasters.
Next to the'

Barry: 'Cos the'

Barry: 'Alex.'

Barry: 'The Alex.'

Barry: 'and then they got [UNK]'

[UNK]: '[UNK] He paid it.'

Barry: 'Paid it through the court.'

Barry: 'Well that was remarkably'

[UNK]: 'Lucky.'

Barry: 'lucky.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah I know.'

Barry: 'He didn't half go for a lot again.'

[UNK]: 'Yes we did seem to be quite lucky to keep [UNK].'

Barry: 'Yeah.
But I, I, I'm amazed that breweries keep lending him money!'

Barry: 'I know.'

Barry: 'I mean, it's unbelievable, you know th er, he's done so many breweries and yet why they don't talk to wo well I mean they must talk to one another.'

[UNK]: 'Because you get people like Ben [UNK] who's giving his money he doesn't really give a toss!'

Barry: 'He don't give a toss.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'As long as he's got an installation going in and if it'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'if it gets written off or'

[UNK]: 'Gets bigger.'

Barry: 'or someone has to take a, a bi a co company has to take a big lot off.'

Barry: 'It's par for the course really.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'Well, you know.'

Barry: 'Dreadful innit?'

Barry: 'Well he's got that much money to burn Barry that's what it is.'

Terri: 'forgotten all about it, anyway she found a little dent apparently our Laura said that's just as bad as finding lumps.

Barry: 'You know like you being all pathetic.'

Terri: 'No.
Well, a bit I intend carrying on as the parliamentary candidate and somebody had obviously asked Dave [UNK] why it is something has nothing whatsoever to do with the constituency.
That was last time's agent.
And he said, oh well it's probably being discussed at the next meeting.
Well he's under a lot [UNK] or else he won't.
Still he won't come if he thinks there's any messing about.
I mean, i it would be zilch for the Labour Party to try and swap candidates now.
You know it would be just stupid wouldn't it?'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Terri: 'Mm.
What would they achieve?'

Barry: 'Well that's right.
I mean I don't know Dave [UNK]'s just not That's stupid!
Why make any comment whatsoever?'

Terri: 'Yeah.
Why not just keep quiet?
So, you know cos it just says all candidates receiving [UNK].'

Terri: 'I mean Labour can't win either way.
They've got to hope that it'll be resolved before then.
If they put another candidate in it's doesn't do Labour's name any good does it?'

Barry: 'Mm.
Well it's a'

Terri: 'It's a waste'

Barry: 'enough of these ad pamphlets.
Guilt?'

Terri: 'Well it's, it's been looking as though you're you're guilty'

Terri: 'before there's problem a admitted.
I mean as we're not looking to win anyway, I don't know what the hell they're bothered about.
I mean it's not exactly, you know, the world's safest Labour seat is it?'

Barry: 'No.

Terri: 'Well, I haven't got a fax here but I I can send you one because I certainly know my delegates wouldn't want to book at er mm.
Yeah, no well we, we can let you have a copy erm but erm, you know, I, I can't make these reservations at at normal prices, my delegates won't accept that.
So, tell, tell me what you're saying it is.'

Terri: 'So I actually have the same brochure twice.
But erm I know my delegates won't, won't want to book at that er it's, they, they will expect to book at prices quoted in the in the conference register.
Okay.
We will.
Thanks.
Bye.

Barry: 'Well haven't you got a problem if there's no hotels available?'

Terri: 'I have got a massive problem.'

Barry: 'Well you can always commute.'

Terri: 'Well, that's what we do because they won't put up with that.
Have to try'

Barry: 'Is there no hotels I mean, just along that Preston Road?'

Terri: 'Well, that's what I'll have to look for now.
I'm in difficulties now.
And these are quoting er'

Terri: 'Eh?'

Barry: 'You're no the further we, you go away, the further you go away from Blackpool but it's not at'

Barry: 'That was lucky!'

Terri: 'That was very lucky!'

Terri: 'It was Bob who told me he booked we our union normally stay at the Claremont you see.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Terri: 'She said I've got, only got three twin rooms left in the whole of this hotel so I'll ring Francis and tell her.'

Terri: 'It's alright the Claremont.
Oh, they're always quite nice'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.'

Terri: 'and sociable'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Terri: 'with us.'

Terri: 'Francis?
It's Jean here.
I yes, I've just had my massive little row with The Savoy about the prices and they just wanted to charge us the normal price!
So I've said they can get stood on.
And I booked at the Claremont which is, twenty eight pounds.
Well, I'm not being prepared to be held to ransom by them.
And I'm, I'm faxing erm I'm sorry, I'm not gonna fax it, I'm just going to send a letter to national office about The Savoy in First Leisure.
Because they can't do this to delegates!
Cos they did it with you last year didn't they?
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I think we should tell national office that this is, you know, this is happening and it's not on!
I've got I'll tell you what I've got, I've got for nineteen ninety two confere Register of Conference Accommodation, from national office whe where they tell you to book!
You know, cos I'd got it at a P P C as well, for national conference.
So I've actually two you see.
So erm I'm sending one back to national office saying, these hotels are sending confirmation at the full price for local government conference.
Now I, I've rung the Claremont and they've said, oh yes, it's the conference erm you know amount and we're very, appar we were, I was very lucky cos we got the last three rooms.
And she said, we're absolutely booked up!
But, you see Bob told me about it, he said, well he, you know booked at the Claremont because he'd had problems getting prices out of the others.
But, our union always stay at the Claremont and we've always found it, you know, okay.
But I'm, I'm not paying sixty five quid a night!
It's just stupid Francis!
Cos you're never in it.
I mean, you always go to you know, somewhere else don't you?'

Terri: 'I didn't ask Francis, so just let me tell you erm they were when I went, it's A, B, D, E, and it's got all the letters next to them.
You know, they say there's a full range of facilities and I'm just looking A is central, bedroom, I'll tell you, I'll, I'll, I'll, we'll whiz through them.
A is central heating, C is car parking, D is street car parking, E is special diets catered for, F, tea and coffee making facility, G is television in bedrooms at no extra charge I is for [UNK] answering and J [UNK] K, I've, I'm, just to go all through this, disabled facilities, L separate [UNK] M bedrooms available with private telephones in, it's N, number of bedrooms available with private bathroom and toilet or shower and toilet.
And that's what it says.
It was, was when I went Francis.
Night porter, Q is lifts to all floor, and S is swimming pool and I know there's a swimming pool because not that I ever used it, but ma it, it was when I booked Francis.
It's right on the prom on the corner on, on North Prom.
It's not far from the Imperial Francis.
So but it was erm just go on that bit of the prom, it's huge!
It's a huge hotel on the corner.
You can't miss it.
I'll, I'll give you the o the address anyway.
Erm, two hundred and seventy North Prom.
Yeah.
Two seventy North Prom.
Erm, and you just say what yeah, two seventy North Prom.
It's, it's pa just past, if you keep going past the Pembroke it's there.
But erm that's right, going out.
Yes.
It's just past there.
You can't lose it Francis, cos it's one of the major hotels.
Yeah.
They've got, they've got lots of bars, there's a bar in the basement and there's bars upstairs, and a dance floor and a swimming pool and I'm sure it will Francis.
I mean yeah, well I don't blame him.
But it says number of bedrooms available with private bathroom and toilet, or shower and toilet.
There are very few hotels of this standard that don't have showers and toilets.
So it's twenty eight Francis, which is, I think is yes.
Yes.
Well, it doesn't matter where we go to eat does it?
And we, can go and eat wherever we want.
Oh!
But th you can have bed and breakfast and evening meal if you want.
Erm, but generally, ye I mean cos Eileen and I go to a [UNK] we nearly always go somewhere like Carriages or you know, somewhere Italian which is, you know, it might, it all depends on what Jim's eating at the time.
But, but you can't go wrong, there's plenty to eat in Blackpool can you?
In fact, I'm trying to think of a place that erm we once went when we at regional conference, it was behind the Claremont somewhere.
It was a it was a little Italian restaurant with about forty six and we went at regional conference and it was astounding!
It was a really brilliant chef!
I'll try and get Bob to find the the number of it.
Cos that was really a really nice place.
But, you wouldn't have expected to find it where you found it.
No.
You know the road behind the promenade?
It was on that road.
And we only found it by chance, you know how you go off to think oh I'll, I'll go and find a coffee or something, and we found this restaurant at lunch time and had a coffee there and we looked at the menu and, you know, we, we couldn't believe it!
Yeah.
Well I'll try, I'll try and get Bob to remember the name of it.
Alright.
And so I'll see you when we get there Francis.
I said we'll a probably arrive early afternoon.
So no doesn't well you know what he'll be like, he'll be messing about all day.
But I know Kinnock's speaking at four isn't he?
So we I want to Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh well he'll have to be then.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's alright.
Don't worry.
I'll, I'll look after [UNK].
Because there's erm there's Geoff and Louise are staying with us, and Eileen and I are staying.
You and Jim are staying.
And I know that Bob and Sue have booked at the Claremont so there'll be quite a few of us there.
So, I'll, I'll keep an eye on us.
And I'll go and have a look at your room.
Just to make sure everything's alright before he gets there.
Right.
Thanks Francis.
See you Friday.
Bye.
I should have checked that shouldn't I?'

Barry: 'Well [UNK] is a en suite.'

Terri: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'I don't think it is gonna be en suite.'

Terri: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Well they said, the number of rooms didn't it?
Didn't say all rooms.
And if you've got the last three I can't believe that the last three are en suite.'

Terri: 'I only need one en suite.'

Barry: 'That's what I thought!'

Terri: 'It'll be two rooms and a bath or a shower.
Shall I ring back?'

Barry: 'I stayed at the Claremont when I was down doing [UNK] and I can't remember where it is on the street [UNK].'

Terri: 'Well, I we were when I went'

Barry: 'John was.
John but mind you, John has been insistent on it, he'

Terri: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'moved a whole delegation if it weren't en suite.'

Terri: 'Yeah.
Well Bob will do me a swap if it's gonna come to a crisis.
I think I'll ring Madge up.
Cos it will cause a crisis'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.'

Terri: 'with Jim.'

Barry: 'Of course.
I mean he's at the age of being incontinent int he?'

Terri: 'Call me regional [UNK].
Is he introducing a conference now?'

Barry: 'John unwashed and unshaved on the front delegate, on the front.'

Terri: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
I'd er ring up just in case cos you might have to solve your problem.
Better to knowing now than to know when you arrive there.
Have they mended your photocopier yet?'

Terri: 'No.
They won't be [UNK] if you want to photocopy something.'

Barry: 'I might do.'

Terri: 'But we'll give them a ring now anyway.'

Barry: 'I need to get hold of Mayfair as well cos there's cigarettes out so'

Terri: 'Hello, it's Mrs [UNK] here, I've just spoken to the other lady making a booking for three twin rooms.
Can you just check whether they're en suite.
They are?
Oh brilliant!
You've saved my life!
Else my chairman was er, just gonna give [UNK].
Oh!
That's great!
No problem.
Thanks.
Bye.'

Barry: 'Phew!
Yeah.'

Terri: 'Better telephone so that she can be sure that when he asks the dreaded question that they are.
Must remember I've got to talk to him about here.'

Terri: '[UNK] The answer is yes, they all are.
Ah!
Francis I had a little panic then, and I decided to ring them back.
But, no yeah yeah well, I thought, I thought I'd better be safe, yeah.
I don't want a weekend with Jim where I, I'm in trouble all weekend!
Oh don't Francis!
I mean er, I'd, I'd never have lived it down.
Yeah.
Well that's what he'd say to me, why didn't find out first?
So, anyway, you're reduced from, so it's en suite.
Yeah.
She said exactly Francis!
Well we'll spend it on food and drink Francis.
But erm er, I feel a lot more comfortable cos I think sixty five pounds a night's outrageous!
For just spending well, for us, when we're just, you're only there for your breakfast aren't you?
You never go back again.
So because we'll be able to have lunch at British Home Stores.
We'll not be able to break with tradition.
Geoff will insist that we go to British Home Stores for, well we'll, if, if we we're with Geoff and Louise, that's where we generally go to lunch, and it's really nice!
It's a lovely self-service in Blackpool.
But you know the Labour Party is worse than the Conservatives for traditions aren't they?
Mm.
Anyway, look I'll find out from Bob about this restaurant and see if there's a possibility that it might be worth booking before I go.
But I know that Jim's going to have to [UNK].
And I I don't want to spend all night chasing round Blackpool looking for for a place that serves ordinary food of a decent standard.
Right Francis.
I'll leave on that note.
Bye.
Yeah, she does want to go.
They don't want him trailing down th'

Terri: '[UNK] well we're in a [UNK] next week.'

Barry: 'It would be a couple of days.'

Terri: 'I think it's [UNK].'

Barry: 'I want Mayfair as well.
I want Mayfair to come.'

Terri: 'Filling the machine?'

Barry: 'Fill it up.
It's empty, so Mayfair fills it up.'

Terri: '[UNK] You don't know where he is do you?
Oh!
Right.
Okay.
I'll try County Hall.
Right.
Thanks.
Bye.'

Barry: 'What's it called Mains?'

Terri: 'Mains Business Services.
It's here [UNK] I think, but I'm not sure.'

Barry: 'Mains, Mains, Mains, Mains.
Oh!
They have been getting Ma Macs first don't they?
For some unknown reason! [UNK].'

Terri: 'Well can I have the Labour group then please?'

Barry: 'You tell me why they has Mac before Mains.
Mm.'

Terri: 'Right.'

Barry: 'L M, Main.
H, I, J, K [UNK].'

Terri: 'Close.'

## 064203

Terri: 'Sor if I sorted out being able to book at this restaurant which only is about [UNK] I'd be in'

Barry: 'How many nights are you there, two?'

Terri: 'Two.
Be in if, everybody's good books.
Cos it really, it's really nice!
We just found it by chance.'

Barry: 'You can't, can't'

Terri: 'It'

Barry: 'remember what it's called?'

Terri: 'I know!
I just can't.
Bob'll know.'

Barry: 'Well you probably, I mean you, you as, you as well, so I mean, you probably won't'

Terri: 'No he's'

Barry: 'be able to get there till this evening and you probably won't be able to see him will you?'

Terri: 'No.
Well a as long as he knows I'm looking for him.
They erm wa when we to we, we were staying at the Claremont and I don't, oh, I think we just decided we'd find a cup of coffee.
It was M S F thing, we were with Margaret [UNK] about the M S F.
And said, oh, let's go and find a cup of coffee but, have a bit of a walk and walk down to conference but we'll not walk down the prom'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Terri: 'we'll walk down the road at the back and we'd only just turned round the corner from the Claremont and we found this restaurant and it was, it was an absolutely brilliant chef, really nice restaurant, really high quality and it was was quite reasonable price, it wasn't cheap.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Terri: 'So, when we found this we thought ooh, this is alright!
You know, we'll so we've been quite a few times since, but I cannot think of the name of it.
You see, Jim doesn't like, I mean, we'd go to Carriages probably cos it's a a proper Italian'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Terri: 'that absolutely reeks with garlic and all the rest of it.
Well that means Jim will pull a face!
Or he'll start going'

Barry: 'Oh, this big international financier!'

Terri: 'Oh!
No!
Not, I mean, is the, when it comes down to food wi he's a traditionalist.
So we've always got to find somewhere to eat that's'

Barry: 'You're gonna be pushed getting, you know, roast beef and Yorkshire in Brussels aren't you?'

Terri: 'God knows!'

Barry: 'Steak and kidney pie!'

Terri: 'You're joking!
Cos everybody sort of, just try to think, think of in Brussels.
Why they go, they go to er a six course sort of have as much main course as you like.
It's a a a re a really nice restaurant but you can pick all your food raw and they just, there's a chef cooking, and you just get one of these plates, you can have as many helpings as you want, they serve you a cold starter and a hot starter but there's a buffet that's about half the size of our club and one side of it it's all fish on a wet fish slab, and steak, and veal, and chicken and so there's every sort of meat you can think of, and you can pick a wooden platter full of it, so you go and give it the chef with this number that they give you and then they come serve you with whatever you want.
And you can have as many helpings of whatever you want.
And the salad stuff and fresh fruit and all that sort of thing, takes about the full length of our bar up you know, you, you couldn't think of a salad that isn't there.
But you can't, and there's, then there's loads of hot veg.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Terri: 'There's no vegetables you can't mention.
I think it's about twenty quid a head, but you can actually have as many meals as you want, or as many puddings as you want.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Terri: 'It's it really is really very, very good.
The Labour Party came to to use that quite a lot.
Because they've got big seating areas as well, where they put, sort of eight tables together and all your party can sit together.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Terri: 'When we were there Stan [UNK] was with us and he'd been a few times to Brussels to with the Labour Party and, and he said oh it's great!
Because usually you go off to a restaurant and if there's twenty of you you can't sit together can you?'

Barry: 'No.
No.'

Terri: 'But, he said, this restaurant makes a particular thing of seating big parties.
It was a brilliant restaurant!
Really really nice.
So you know'

Barry: 'Sergio's going to erm erm one, some Cubs visit to London at er half term.'

Terri: 'Baden Powell House?'

Barry: 'Yeah, but the'

Terri: 'Mary took it.
It's brilliant!
Absolutely great!'

Barry: 'And er, so she said she, she wants to take the last couple of days away'

Terri: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'so she's, her aunty's going to Dublin, so I got these things and they were really cheap actually.
There's the train fare from here to Holyhead return, the ferry, transfers to their hotel the best hotel in Dublin, The Burlington'

Terri: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'is absolutely stupendous!
Two nights bed and breakfast, full Irish breakfast, which means you won't need to eat until the evening!'

Terri: 'You won't eat again.
No.'

Barry: 'Erm train, free bus passes round Dublin, includes their bus fares and, and train on those sort of metro type thing'

Terri: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'they have in Dublin all for eighty five quid!'

Terri: 'Eh?'

Barry: 'I know.'

Terri: 'Why?'

Barry: 'The only problem is, that the hotel that Mary's like, ah!
This looks beautiful.
Cos I, I, that second hotel, [UNK] hotel, the only thing, is the Burlington.
And I daren't, I'm not gonna tell her, but I, I, I'm trying to say, well, it's a little bit out, it's in a park and er, th th but it looks gorgeous!
I said, yeah I know.
And it was, where they had their honeymoon.'

Barry: 'So I'm going, oh no!
Not for [UNK] just er Siobhan, and sister-in-law, erm is the head of Town and Travel and, Manchester'

Terri: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Town and Travel, and she got the presidential suite at the Burlington which is like a, you know, I mean, erm, it's absolutely gorgeous!
And it was, it was about two hundred pounds a night and got it for ten pounds a night.
That was about, well, ten years ago, when well well it's really appropriate.
So I think, well this is a, this is actually on O'Connell Street, that's right in the centre.

Barry: 'Oh yeah.'

Terri: 'is now going to be at the [UNK].
We think she should, might stand down gracefully, if she doesn't erm she, we could refuse to adopt, but she's over there personally.
Erm, I'm in two minds about what to do.
I could name names and say because this is not a party decision, it's'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Terri: 'Dave [UNK], Steve [UNK], etcetera, and [UNK].
Now, who's Dave [UNK]?
Senior employee of the City Council'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Terri: 'meeting with the leader of the Labour group who's supposedly doing all this to protect his wife.
The reason he's married to her I mean, even [UNK].
I could, I could really throw the dirt at them by saying that I'll, you know, if there is a conspiracy there's, a person here who's been involved in a very iffy part of the budget, who all of a sudden after ten years of slagging off the town clerk, all of a sudden he's totally on the town clerk's side, together with Councillor [UNK].
Why?
The only person who's involved in both, allowing the town clerk to take these decisions, without any interference at all'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Terri: 'and now conspiring with a senior employee of the council, and of course, [UNK].
Just not so.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Terri: 'All of a sudden this erm worry about this budget heading, is being swept under the carpets and everybody being told is all in been er cleared up.
It's Dave [UNK] [UNK].
I'd fire him.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Terri: 'I could really make this into a very great conspiracy for [UNK].'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Terri: 'Apart from which, this meeting that they're supposed to be going to have is totally out of order anyway.
Cos nobody's been sent any notices for it or notified about it.
So I mean, I, I could'

Barry: 'What the hell are they doing now!'

Terri: 'get the full meeting cance I mean, you get Ashdown yesterday, his party rally round him like'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Terri: 'royalty's going of fashion!
You get, I mean, Dave [UNK] and Steve [UNK], alright, they've never been my favourite people but all this pious goings-on with Dave [UNK], how much he hates the town clerk, and whatever opportunity he could get he would'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Terri: 'take.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Terri: 'First opportunity, real opportunity he gets he's doing everything the town clerk wants him to do.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Terri: 'I just, I, I, honestly Barry, I've got to the stage where I believe in this conspiracy [UNK].'

Barry: 'Mm.
Well certainly some people want some answers want to be given on this budget, er me as well, I mean, he can't just suddenly say'

Terri: 'Well'

Barry: 'it's all been sorted out, don't worry about it.'

Terri: 'Well I think it will be really stupid.
[UNK] But I shall say Dave [UNK]'

Barry: 'And how long [UNK]?
Well I park'

Terri: 'I'll put'

Barry: 'er'

Terri: 'I'll drop you off.
Cos I want to go home and [UNK], I've got to home cos I've I've a stack of paperwork on my table.
I'm not gonna be able to set off much later on remember because'

Terri: 'There's no point in me getting'

Barry: 'Nope.'

Terri: 'I'll have to go up to shop to get some shopping cos there's nothing to eat in the house.
So I'll have to do something [UNK].
Alright Barry? [UNK]'

Barry: 'I just wonder what on earth they're, they're playing at with ha, cha cha cha cha cha cha.
You know, I just don't understand what they're playing but th you know'

Terri: 'They'

Barry: 'they can only be doing damage to th to the election chances I mean'

Terri: 'Well they'

Barry: 'they can't be achieving anything else!'

Terri: 'I mean saying things like a successor has already been identified.
I mean it's just stupid!
Cos the general view in Morecambe isn't what they say it is.'

Barry: 'Yeah, but it gives the impression there's a split group innit?'

Terri: 'Well, you give the impression of a a faction in the party, now I could, I could serve this faction quite easily to Mike [UNK] who'd give me a lot of say if I said, you know, th the the plot thickens, you know, here's a town'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Terri: 'hall employee'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Terri: 'always an opponent of the town clerk also now erm trying to cause problems.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Terri: 'I mean, that really does make the plot thicken doesn't it?'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Terri: 'I mean, why was Dave [UNK] being quoted for [UNK], what has it got to with Dave [UNK]?
He's not an officer of the constitut he isn't a treasurer, he isn't secretary, he's, he's nothing as far the constituency's concerned.
They, if they want any quotes why don't they go and see chairman, who's Terry?'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Terri: 'I mean, this is them deliberately saying things to their friends and deliberately stirring it.
They, oh!
Because, I mean, I know where it's coming from, some of it's coming from Stanley [UNK], who, who thinks if I don't stand down it will damage Ruth's chances.
That's not Ruth's own view of it.
Well it, and I don't think with the News of the World round their necks they can afford to start playing silly people.
Because I'm, you know, if they sa if they keep crossing me the way they are, quite frankly I'm you know, willing to make remarks myself.
Although I don't want to do damaging things, but I don't see why I should be the person con cons constantly getting the flack from a group of people who were you know.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Terri: 'Who are genuinely trying to do damage to the party.
So do you want me to call at the [UNK]'s now?'

Barry: 'Yeah.
There's, may as well.
Well, don't know.
Well it doesn't really matter, I'll, I'll be I mean, what, so I mean there's except for seeing Anne there's nothing more to do is there?'

Terri: 'Well except to start getting that rubbish cleared away.'

Barry: 'Well I can't put it away.
Don't want a pile in the cellar when carpet delivery comes.'

Terri: 'No, but I pu put it next to the lift and as soon as Hughey comes put it outside and when I come back I'll take it away.'

Barry: 'No you won't cos I'm meeting Ellial at, at half three.'

Terri: 'Well I mean, I should be back for half past two.
I mean, if you want to just put it in that dustbin place and we'll take it tomorrow.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Terri: 'You know, the washing up machine and everything, all, all of that needs cleaning out, all behind the bar needs cleaning.
We're giving people a very bad impression if we're opening tonight and nothing's been cleared up.
I think I'll go for it Barry.
I'll, I'll go and see where he is, and say, you know That washing up and everything wants doing before tonight so you, so if you're gonna say oh, we're open tonight and the place still looks like a pig stye!
It ain't gonna give a very good impression.'

Barry: 'Well he's not gonna want to, he's not, sha I mean he's it's not a meeting to look around the place is it really?'

Terri: 'Well it is.
That's what they're coming for.
That's one of the things Richard [UNK] is coming for, to look round.
We'll come and have a good look round, I've never seen it.
I mean, er, you know what that's to do with don't you?
The repairs notice.
Even if we only got all those old tickets and things into green bags and started cleaning that out it would it would look as though we're making some effort.
Er, if I can get the [UNK] and get him to come in reasonably soon, you know, I'll ring you and tell you whether he's in.
If we could get him to come in reasonably quickly you could get all that stuff down and bagged up and we could get rid of it couldn't we?'

Barry: 'Which which tickets are you talking about?'

Terri: 'Well all the old tickets and stuff, I mean, alright'

Barry: 'Where?
From where?'

Terri: 'In, the bottom office.'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.'

Terri: 'As well as all the junk that's in the cleaner's room, it all wants getting rid of.
I mean, what's happening about these speakers then?
I mean, is this supposed to be happening tonight or'

Barry: 'No.'

Terri: 'what's'

Barry: 'Well it's it's a trial.
Go in then.'

Terri: 'Just stop if there's any mail.'

Barry: 'No there's nothing.'

Terri: 'Oh.'

Barry: 'Okay.'

Terri: 'I'll go and get in and get on with'

Barry: 'Alright.'

Hugh: 'The [UNK] one?'

Barry: 'Yeah.
And redoing the stage floor.
And I'm carpeting I think I'll carpet tile'

Hugh: 'Have you had a price on what it's gonna cost to put that down?'

Hugh: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'And, if you'

And just sort of carpet the two top areas, two raised areas, and have the other, the rest of it as a sort of lino floor.'

Hugh: 'Mm mm.'

Barry: 'so that they all go in the [UNK].
Erm, going to somehow, at the moment we're thinking of well Jean'll wanna do it, but I'm I'm thinking of doing some kind of I mean, we're agreed on what we're gonna do, but it's how we do it, I want some ka er, some kind of grilling around the top, the cocktail bar area, so you can open it as a, as a bar, and it'll have a sort of atmosphere in itself, so we open that as a pub type of thing, you know.'

Hugh: 'Oh right!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. [UNK]'

Barry: 'Leave the big screen on and that and we can put erm and get, you know, as I say, if you'

Hugh: 'Do you'

Barry: 'you get, see if we can get hold of like, I mean you won't be able to get hold of a Wurlitzer because nowadays they're like gold dust, but you might be able to get hold of parts, you see.
If you could just get hold of say, the rainbow'

Hugh: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'like that, you know'

Hugh: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'and you just bang those around the place.

Hugh: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'As I say, they expect I've got music, it's not gonna come as a shock to them.'

Hugh: 'They've got [UNK]'

Barry: 'You know, and it'll, and it'll have a sort of atmosphere I think.
And, and it won't cost a lot to do, cos all you do instead of green, you'll paint that red and you've got the white pick out anyway, and a blue, seated blue carpet.'

Hugh: 'I wondered what those fucking [UNK]!'

Hugh: 'No, where am I gonna be able to get rid of this?'

Barry: 'I don't know.'

Barry: 'I think we'll have to, I think we've got to keep it cos I think it's part of the fixtures and fittings unfortunately.'

Barry: 'And I'm gonna do er, you know, lots of promotions and stuff promotions [UNK] on that'

Hugh: 'And then your promotions, yeah?'

Barry: 'I mean they're very sort of vandal easy or whatever.
Vandal a fa er vandal friendly hooligan friendly aren't they?'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Whatever!
You know, I mean we just got them cheap erm lampshades from now on er cos it's not worth it cos th the expensive ones are just getting damaged all the time.'

Alan: 'We could shorten them anyway and just put lamps on them.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'Whatever.
If you don't hang them on Gerry's thingy anyway.'

Barry: 'No you don't.
That's right.
See, if you sort of somehow trellis that area, that side in you could actually have this mo more intimate if people just wanted to'

Alan: 'Snog!'

Barry: 'sit in here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you got, you know, if you got a character behind the bar could er attract people by his own force of personality.'

Alan: 'I think erm you could but you know, really then you think when'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'they come in we can start'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah it is.
Cos I wouldn't lo I mean I actually don't think you can do, if you're gonna do people are gonna eat I th I think you're gonna be pushed at more than about hundred and fifty to two hundred.
You know, depends on how you retail it first but'

Alan: 'I think it depends which it, what you'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'do.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'Erm'

Barry: 'I mean, it depends a as you say, er yeah I mean it does depend that.
Cos if, if you, if you, if you wanted to you could always utilize all the dance floor area tables and things, you know.
If you had that kind of function that you you know'

Alan: 'Mm.
Makes it difficult to do a big functions though in here with that stage.'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.'

Alan: 'You know, to set out'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'you co there's no way'

Barry: 'Yeah it does.'

Alan: 'you can set out for two hundred.'

Barry: 'No.
No.
What we did do'

Alan: 'And so'

Barry: 'very well'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'erm we were we some of the jazz stuff, I mean'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'it it, it never worked in a sense that it wasn't commercially viable'

Alan: 'No.'

Barry: 'but things like Kenny Ball and that we'd had'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'and we had like the ta trestle tables in all these alcoves and people came and actually booked a meal'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'and, and, you had a meal and sat and watched the band and everything.
It wor i I mean for those it did work'

Alan: 'Different [UNK] sort of like'

Barry: 'it did work.'

Alan: 'Yeah.
Just'

Barry: 'But'

Alan: 'need the'

Barry: 'you can see everywhere.
And it did'

Alan: 'Put hot food'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'up at the back as well there.'

Barry: 'Mm.
Have you actually ever seen round this place properly?'

Alan: 'Not properly.
No I haven't really.
Whe whe where do you get to that round, round'

Barry: 'No.'

Alan: 'part?'

Barry: 'No, you can't that's one of the do you wanna sta I'll just go and get the key so you can have a'

Alan: 'Yeah, go on.'

Barry: 'quick look in there.'

Alan: 'I'll go up there.'

Barry: 'Get your bearings.'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'It actually looks bigger looking that way than it does when you're up there looking back, I think.
Erm I'm thinking of atmosphere.
But if we if we carpet the two raised areas in a sort of attract hardwearing linoey type affect on there cos you can'

Alan: 'What about the slipping?'

Barry: 'you can dance.
Well you get'

Alan: 'The carpet, don't it really up here?'

Barry: 'No.
Well i it's been down since it opened so that's'

Alan: 'Oh!'

Barry: 'gotta be eight or nine years.'

Alan: 'Mm!
It's done well then.'

Barry: 'It's done well.'

Alan: 'It was on'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'concrete'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'like.
Oh right.
So this is just, this is just virtually there, you can't get through that way anywhere?'

Barry: 'No you can't, no.'

Alan: 'Oh.
Right.'

Barry: 'Like, so it's sort of self-contained in one'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'sense.
Er'

Alan: 'Right.
So it'll have to be that one in there.'

Barry: 'And'

Alan: 'Oh!
So right.
Right.'

Barry: 'When Trish [UNK] had a do in here, her fortieth she let'

Alan: 'A what?'

Barry: 'er Trish [UNK] had her fortieth birthday here.
She laid there's a tremendous amount of wasted space here really.'

Alan: 'There is!'

Barry: '[UNK] Erm'

Alan: 'Ah!
This stage across.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
She laid out in here and people just wandered in off the back end here.'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'But I mean we've always wanted to utilize this but we can't really we built that wall here and it's just a this is the back of the disco.
I mean al it's all, none of it's sort of'

Alan: 'Determined wall.'

Barry: 'determined walls, I mean, it's no no wall there at all.
I mean we put this up just'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'to break that'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'because this is the console bar.'

Alan: 'Is that Cola?'

Barry: 'It's for it's for the cellar, yeah.'

Alan: 'This is nice and big innit?'

Barry: 'Well it's not, I mean'

Alan: 'Should think they've had quite a few [UNK].'

Barry: 'Not bad.
Oh yeah!
Mm.
Obviously you've got a better eye tha than I have, but er'

Alan: 'You wa er what you want in here is one tha is tha is what's e what's extraction like?
Is it good?'

Barry: 'Fine.'

Alan: 'You want a chair for over here for doing'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'American stuff.'

Barry: 'Yeah, you do, yeah.'

Alan: 'Do kebabs and everything.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
We've got erm somewhere, a pizza oven.'

Alan: 'Oh!
You, have you got a'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'pizza oven?'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

Alan: 'Right.
So that's alright.
I've enough afternoons [UNK].'

Barry: 'Well, you won't need to do that now.
It's somewhere anyway, we've got'

Alan: 'Jesus wept!'

Barry: 'pizza oven.'

Alan: 'What is it?'

Barry: 'Ice making machine.'

Alan: 'What's that, a dishwasher?'

Barry: 'Glass washer, yeah.'

Alan: 'Glass washer, I meant.'

Barry: 'We've got er'

Alan: 'Have you got one behind bar?'

Barry: 'No.
There's not.'

Alan: 'There int one behind the bar?'

Barry: 'No.'

Alan: 'Oh out in garden.
Oh right!
I see.'

Barry: 'So basically they've gotta just tray it up'

Alan: 'What you want is'

Barry: 'tray it up here and then'

Alan: 'yeah, here and then'

Barry: 'bang it straight in.
Erm'

Alan: 'Why's your bar so high?
I can't reach your pump [UNK].'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'Have you?'

Barry: 'We like to keep the floor nice and sticky so the staff can't run away!'

Alan: 'Oh I see.'

Barry: 'Once they're behind here they're stuck all night.'

Alan: 'Think you got some cleaning, you just want that back in.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'You know what I mean, it's got [UNK].
And all that up there.
Mm!
Now then, so you'd carpet them two'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'and then summat washed'

Barry: 'Well you see, hardly anybody ever sa they don't really sit in this area, all they do is er, I mean, they only sit'

Alan: 'Around the bar.'

Barry: 'right at the end of the, you know'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'when it's full they'll sit on those two tables.'

Alan: 'You were going to clear that area anyway, don't they?'

Barry: 'Yeah.
I mean, everybody round here just stands or sits on those bar stools.'

Alan: 'Mm.
Yeah.'

Barry: 'When people first come in they go for the raised areas and sit down.
O'

Alan: 'You have to see.'

Barry: 'or they stand at the bar.
It's, and, and if you actually look on the actual area we're talking about, there's only one, two, three, four, there's only about half a dozen tables.'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Which is, you know, at maximum you're gonna get twenty four people sat around there anyway.
So I think, in a way, it's erm a bit wasted carpeting it all.
Cos it's a big area'

Alan: 'I do.'

Barry: 'to carpet.'

Alan: 'One, two, three'

Barry: 'I mean the quotes we had ranged from sort of'

Alan: 'Well you, wo did you look to change the carpet'

Barry: 'eighteen to twenty seven.'

Alan: 'because of the name on it?'

Barry: 'Well yeah, and'

Alan: 'You are?'

Barry: 'and it's getting past it to be honest.
I mean, these metal strips are down there for the public entertainment license, they weren't gonna give us it because the carpet was lifting.'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'So I mean, not, weren't gonna give us it, but we had to do it for'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'you know, at the time.'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'And you can see like like there can you see straight in front of you there's a worn patch on the carpet, but there's er been a li a bit of a leak at some stage.'

Alan: 'Oh right, I see.'

Barry: 'There's one there.
I mean'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'if you've got it carpeted, once you got that you, you're you're stuck aren't you?
You know'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'you've either got I mean, we've either gotta put a table on top of it or'

Alan: 'Yeah, that's it, or sit on there or get'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'somebody to stand with it'

Alan: 'you know.
Yes.'

Barry: 'Erm or replace the whole damn carpet.
I mean the carpet must have cost a fortune [UNK]!'

Alan: 'Bloody hell!
It must, it must have been absolute arm and a leg.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'Absolute arm and a leg.
Er'

Barry: 'But it it's not a bad size room in the sense that'

Alan: 'No it int, no, it's, it is'

Barry: 'in the sense that you can get three hundred in'

Alan: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'well we often get four hundred in if you're you know, I mean, just have the right'

Alan: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'party erm'

Alan: 'How many you licensed for?'

Barry: 'Three hundred.'

Alan: 'Three.'

Barry: 'But, you can get but a hundred people can have a decent atmosphere as well.'

Alan: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'You know, it'

Alan: 'Well that, that's good you see'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'cos I mean some places that are fairly big th the, if you've got hundred in they just, it looks empty don't it?'

Barry: 'No that's right.
That's right.
I mean'

Alan: 'Erm'

Barry: 'that's the Carlton's problem innit?
You know, if it, unless it gets'

Alan: 'Ooh!
God!
Yeah.'

Barry: 'unless he's got five hundred in yo yo you feel as if you're in a barn aircraft hanger.'

Alan: 'Well that's right.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'But the sort of chromea and all that sort of lends itself to one of them aircraft things doesn't'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'it?
Yeah.'

Barry: 'It does.
It does, yeah.
So you wouldn't have to spend a fortune on, on, on I mean it's only a matter of most of it's a matter of paint, and then hanging a few things up isn't it?
Change the atmosphere.'

Alan: 'Well er, yeah well it is, but I think cos one, you've got to look at, oh a bit of a design as well a while you're at it you might as well just get one or two bits'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.
Yeah.'

Alan: 'you know'

Barry: 'Yeah, yeah.
True.'

Alan: 'Erm oh yeah.
One, two it's alright, I'm trying to think.
if you're gonna make all this into a dance floor and all the rest of it what's the be a er er er benefit of having a stage?
If all this is virtually gonna be it's virtually gonna be dance floor int it really?'

Alan: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'Well there is no benefit.'

Alan: 'Cos if you didn't have that it'd make this room more viable in as much as erm, the point of view of doing doing catering and, functions and all the rest of it.
You can't, you couldn't say right we'll do a function for hundred and fifty and two hundred, and really to do, you've got to be looking to do a, a sit down function for two hundred'

Barry: 'Right.'

Alan: 'if you, because it's more than the Headway can do'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'comfortably.
And it's more than er, and you can certainly do a better job than the Carlton so I mean, you don't call, I mean, you don't call him any competition at all I don't but, you've got to look at being able to do functions for two hundred.'

Barry: 'Mm.
Well two hundred is lost in the Carlton anyway int it?'

Alan: 'Well it is, but having, yeah but with their'

Barry: 'Are you talking about the Carlton or the Carlton Rooms?'

Alan: 'I'm talking about the Carlton.'

Barry: 'Right.'

Alan: 'Not Chelstons.'

Barry: 'Not Chelstons, right.'

Alan: 'The Carlton up'

Barry: 'Right.'

Alan: 'here.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'It, really and truthfully, like the Headway do plenty of functions and the rest of it but you can do a better job than Headway.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'No two ways about, wi it in a min in a [UNK].
But if you can do, if, if you can do a two hundred thing for sit down you're gonna be in among the functions.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'Definitely.
Plus the fact like you sa er like I say, if you're gonna have a dance floor in here there int any benefit about having the raised area is there?'

Barry: 'No, that's very true.'

Alan: 'And er, and it, it it makes a lot of difference actually.
I would have thought so.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'I mean, cos the bands can still set up can't they?'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.'

Alan: 'If they sit up here'

Barry: 'Well you can do what, yeah.'

Alan: 'Yeah.
But they still sit up there and they can still see them.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'And it's makes it a it makes it a different space, totally different.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'And like I say, if you're gonna carpet it er not carpet it, you're gonna cover it you might as well cover it totally.'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.
Well'

Alan: 'I wonder what you'd use though?'

Barry: 'You ca you're gonna, you're gonna cover it, I mean we've got to re'

Alan: 'You've gotta cover that anyway.'

Barry: 'we've got to re-cover that'

Alan: 'That's what'

Barry: 'stage anyway.'

Alan: 'So you're not so all you're'

Barry: 'So'

Alan: 'doing is taking that out, but'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'surely in a lot of ways it might makes all the difference Barry.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'Makes it and it makes in a way [UNK] so that it, it's not a'

Barry: 'Well you can create a dance floor area with tables and chairs.'

Alan: 'Yeah, course you can.'

Barry: 'All you do is just put them round there.'

Alan: 'Just put them round.'

Barry: 'I mean that's all we did in the Sugar House'

Alan: 'Well that's terrific!'

Barry: 'they've got er actual flat floors.'

Alan: 'Get rid of all that and you have got more table area because i they can sort of sit in th in the, the'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'gangway'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'you know, so I think, I think that would it's alright I just keep freezing up.'

Barry: 'Do you wanna sit in there rather than'

Alan: 'No my, I'm better stood here.'

Barry: 'Oh.'

Alan: 'No I'm better stood here.
But I've got to I do this you know, I just sit and look.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'Oh no, I don't stand a lot.'

Alan: 'Well that's but I've, I've got to er, so I think definitely that wants to come out.
Erm and er'

Barry: 'Because, I mean, if you ever got anything you really need a little, you could always bring a little stage in.'

Alan: 'Well [UNK] Yeah.
Staging's no problem is'

Barry: 'No.'

Alan: 'it?'

Barry: 'No.'

Alan: 'You know'

Barry: 'I mean'

Alan: 'now we need erm alright we're gonna, we'll keep these mirrors and everything.
Them mirror tiles and everything.'

Barry: 'I should think so.
They cost us a fortune!'

Alan: 'Cos I mean them marked [UNK].
I nearly ca what they call it?
Aren't they?'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'Called the [UNK].
Er, it's just that re-seating that just on that middle one actually, that's bad int it?'

Barry: 'Mm.
Well I've, yo you need to redo the, the fixed seating.
I mean, some of it o you'll get away with, but generally you re you need to recover it, it's going all over the place and it'

Alan: 'What if you could get something with stars and stripes on?'

Barry: 'Mm.
Yes, but it's dirt on it.
The trouble with the American red, it's a, it's, it's not a maroon it's a'

Alan: 'No, it's'

Barry: 'bright pillar box type'

Hugh: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'red innit?'

Alan: 'Yes.'

Barry: 'You know it's'

Alan: 'Oh my God!
You don't want to'

Barry: 'So if anybody, if anybody spills anything on it or whatever'

Alan: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'it's gonna show like a [UNK].'

Alan: 'Yeah.
Well that's one's left, cos that one, well it's better than green when it's down isn't it?'

Barry: 'Mm.
But I thi'

Alan: 'I know that sort of creates that atmosphere there but I think erm sorry!
Go on.
Get them lamps down, I think.
Cos I mean, yo you can easily chop them off and put summat else smaller on can't you with lamps on?'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'If you want to create that sort of an atmosphere.
Are we there int a door is there from kitchen to there?'

Barry: 'Well it's'

Alan: 'There's just a hatch which is alright'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'because then well that'll just do service from there, but the only trouble about that is that [UNK].
Anyway, not to worry.'

Barry: 'Alright.'

Alan: 'Round again then.
Nay problem.'

Barry: 'I mean, if you've got a function you haven't got that much of bar trade'

Alan: 'No, but'

Barry: 'in the sense that'

Alan: 'No.'

Barry: 'being busy have you?'

Alan: 'No.'

Barry: 'You know.'

Alan: 'No.
No.
And is [UNK] erm yeah I think that'd make all the difference if that comes out.
You can soon redo the D J's little er'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.
No, I think you'd leave the D J's [UNK]'

Alan: 'Oh yeah, but I mean you can soon sort of make it so that it's er'

Barry: 'Oh yeah, well Jean keeps buying'

Alan: 'it's extended.'

Barry: 'Jean keeps, Jean keeps buying these this atrocious cheap wallpaper and sticking it everywhere!'

Alan: 'Oh my God!'

Barry: 'Look at that!'

Alan: 'Well yeah, it looks erm you can put same thing up, but properly.'

Barry: 'Oh yeah.
Yeah.'

Alan: 'Erm that's that'

Barry: 'Well on that you could do something stars and stripesey all round there couldn't you?'

Alan: 'Yeah you could.

Nice lad him.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'Really nice lad.
So erm I went to, where is it you said?
Couldn't find one American cookery book.
Well that int true, I could find one and it were twenty seven pounds fifty so I left it was, full of pretty pictures!'

Alan: 'Isn't that a lot?'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'But I found some barbecue recipes and all that that'd be good.'

Barry: 'Yeah, I mean, the other thing on, on American of course, is you can do all that Cajun stuff can't you?'

Alan: 'Yeah, that's, that's, yes, that's what I wanna'

Barry: 'And New Orleans area, you know.'

Alan: 'that's what I thought because I've got erm I've got a somewhere, I've got four hundred and some cookery book!'

Barry: 'Oh.'

Alan: 'I've never been interested in American stuff.
Well Cajun stuff and all that I thought, and then there's them you can do some long kebabs and all that, that's why if we get one of them charcoal grills that you can pa shoo, shee shoo.
You know, not er all easy.
And, and if you're gonna do burgers we'll do proper burgers, you know not [UNK].
But you can do like, you can do vegetarian burgers and all sorts.
So erm is that paper up there?'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'Look erm could do with being [UNK], having a doorway across back of here couldn't they?
Oh!
I don't know though bu er, opening and shutting doors don't appeal to me when you [UNK].'

Barry: 'No.
No.
True.'

Alan: 'Looks nice but'

Barry: 'Yeah I mean this looks almost like a school but I mean'

Alan: 'Well, no, well, I thi but I think some, some you're better with two shelves really.
In, in a way for for quick, quick'

Barry: 'Well nowadays, nowadays everybody wants two drinks anyway don't'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'they?
I mean it's not like'

Alan: 'No, but, but'

Barry: 'it used to be a'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'everybody wanted warm [UNK]'

Alan: 'When you think about if you just serving two or three hundred [UNK] to keep opening and shutting bloody cupboard doors, erm, fridge doors, it's no good.
Chill's best, I think anyway.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'So erm so, yeah, right, I've got oh! [UNK]'

Barry: 'Yeah, I thi yeah I think you're right actually.
You need to get rid of that and it's and create a dance floor'

Alan: 'Yeah, create'

Barry: 'what, and what I'd do is I'd put a few more spots in'

Alan: 'Yes.'

Barry: 'no, those spots around'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'there shining on the'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'floor, put some round the back so'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'you actually just use'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'see, but I er, I think creative use of spotlights is better than, than specialized lighting effects, which A, cost a fortune, but B'

Alan: 'And you get out of'

Barry: 'as soon as you've seen them they're out of date.'

Alan: 'Well that's it.
That's right.'

Barry: 'Cos they're only effective one time, that's the first time you see them.'

Alan: '[UNK], yeah.'

Barry: 'After that, it's'

Alan: 'And we don't want to fork, I mean, [UNK]'

Barry: 'No.
No.
So erm I mean you can just use coloured spots it in, I mean, those at the moment are just literally stage spots, all they are i are on, and on dim'

Alan: 'Oh right.
Yeah.'

Barry: 'then you can dim them up or whatever'

Alan: 'Yeah, I have them'

Barry: 'but they can't flash'

Alan: 'No.'

Barry: 'so what we need is a small unit in there and, and, I mean, it's only two or three hundred quid er, and a few erm'

Alan: 'Most places where erm, you know they've got them in that, where you go to'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'you can pick stuff up for next to nowt.
Just have it ready- made, say you want it for'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Well, marvellous!'

Alan: 'But I think er er yeah I think that's definite, take that out, it really, it really would make the difference to erm'

Barry: 'Yeah it would, actually, thinking about it.'

Alan: 'Would, it'd make it it'd make it well, it'd just transform it, I mean, just no two ways about it, I think.
You've got that erm what time's that chap coming, half past three?'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'Well I think er is this, alright if I look in here or'

Barry: 'Yeah, course.'

Alan: 'I'll just get my erm'

Barry: 'Yeah, I mean i it's keep on walking round till you get familiar with it.'

Alan: 'Yeah, well that, I mean, I just, yeah, cos I need'

Barry: 'In'

Alan: 'to'

Barry: 'in there is staff toilets and your spirit store.'

Alan: 'Oh.

Alan: 'yeah, but where's erm'

Barry: 'Cellar?'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Down below the bottom.
Yeah.'

Alan: 'Right down, and how, do you have to go outside to get to it?
That's a bit silly!'

Barry: 'It's a pain in the neck!
But it's er'

Alan: 'Well that's how it is at the minute innit?
So'

Barry: 'But, now, Volks actually looked at erm buildi putting a lift in and building a lift to it.'

Alan: 'Oh!
You can't be doing with that.'

Barry: 'I mean but okay, well all it means is, you get twen yo once you start getting busy you get twenty twos not elevens.
I mean'

Alan: 'And thirty sixes eventually [UNK].'

Barry: 'And thirty sixes that's right.'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'No, no.'

Alan: 'I can't imagine anything worse than doing a function for three or four because by the, by the laws of average how the hell are you gonna get it out to them all as it should be?'

Barry: 'I mean, de a I, I think he doesn't do a bad job on to be fair'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'down there.'

Barry: 'That's right.'

Alan: 'Then er which is nice, i it forty's lovely!
Forty's absolutely lovely to do.
And that, and that's it, but I mean, to do, to have somewhere to do two hundred like this would be absolutely incredible!
Could always do small weddings down there and, and then the big do'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'at night up here.
That'd make that just totally makes it different.
I want to just go and have a look in them you see if you've well anyway [UNK] Well erm, I might get [UNK] to a certain extent.
Cos you're nearly'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: '[UNK] aren't you?'

Barry: 'Mm.
Again, this is look it's the same as this.
Shit!'

Alan: 'Well where's that go?'

Barry: 'That's the fire escape down to outside.'

Alan: 'Oh so you couldn't you'd have to leave them [UNK]'

Barry: 'No you can't, no you can't, no.
But that's that area we were looking at.
Either side of the disco console.
That's the passageway we just walked down.
And that's the area you were banging.'

Alan: 'Oh that's where I were banging on wall?'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'Right.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'Well that'd be fine because then it means that you've got either you've got your back in'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'and out, or whichever way'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'round you'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'want to do it.
So that fine, all this comes down.
And you can still sort of ma make it elevated up this really nice and'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'whatever.
That's that wallpaper int it?'

Barry: 'Yeah!'

Alan: 'Right, so this is'

Barry: 'It's actually you know, if you took the time you make a tremendous, it'd make a tremendous big area wouldn't it?'

Alan: 'Brilliant!'

Barry: 'No messing!'

Alan: 'Right, depends what the and quite honestly, if you bring these down and make them a bit more romantic'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'you know.'

Barry: 'God knows what they'll get up to!'

Alan: 'Well I a don't give a bugger, me!'

Alan: 'I aren't bothered for them.
Fifteen there's fifteen there and whatever they need here.
Thirty seven.
See you could seat fifty on here.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
I, I think I ca I, once upon a time I did on the fixed seating for, for I think you could get about a hundred and twenty round'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'there.'

Alan: 'O as it is?'

Barry: 'Yeah.
As it is.'

Alan: 'Yeah.
Packed out.
Er'

Barry: 'But you see the other thing, the other thing that er that's worth, when you've had the smaller dos, you know'

Alan: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'sort of even, even like sixty, eighty people you can lay one of these raised areas out as the big cold buffet area'

Alan: 'Oh the buffet, yeah.
Yeah.'

Barry: 'which kills a lot'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'of space in the club.'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'The only thing that worries me about taking that out is that you then create a massive empty space, if you have got'

Alan: 'No you don't.'

Barry: 'sixty, seventy people you have to then'

Alan: 'No you don't because what you do is, you do it down there.'

Barry: 'Well'

Alan: 'And this is off'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'innit?'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Then you go back and sit up there.'

Alan: 'That's it.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'Yeah.
You do it down there, and this is erm if you did it over there it would look absolutely dreadful!
You do it down there, you set it up in the middle and you set it up really nice and cosy.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'And then er'

Barry: 'We got a lot, we got a, quite a lot of these little blue tables so you could actually'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'surround the dance floors'

Alan: 'Oh yes.
No, no'

Barry: 'but we'

Alan: 'messing.'

Barry: 'push, you know, push people into the dance floor so they're there anyway.'

Alan: 'Yeah, and you make a totally, you make a totally different erm it's, it in one sort of minor operation if you like, alright, minor to a'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'certain extent, you've totally transformed it Barry.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'And it, it'

Barry: 'That's right.'

Alan: 'definitely looks so different.
I mean, even if you didn't do anything else.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'But I think erm, you've just got to er, we've just got to er gerrit sorted.
It, it, it int gonna take much sorting and get the you know'

Barry: 'Mm.
We could use that chrome railing around'

Alan: 'Well you co'

Barry: 'area'

Alan: 'yeah you could use that chrome railing elsewhere, we could'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'you know.
I don't think you, you've, you've got to try in a way not to shut it off too much erm and yet it, i you've just got to sort of be able to not shut it off but sort of create different areas'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Alan: 'within one big area i i if you can and I think shutting things, I think putting trellising up to, not trellising but that sort of thing, to a certain extent at the minute we don't need and I think I'll have to come a time er too when it's open as well to get'

Barry: 'Now, wha what I was just thinking of'

Alan: 'Yes.
But it could be just on a Saturday and Sun'

Barry: 'is it, if you, if you're using, if you're gonna use it as a pub as well'

Alan: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'on a Saturday and a Sunday'

Alan: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'which I think you can do with Amer certainly in the summer season if you Americanize it and all that and, and just, well I mean, we, we did'

Alan: 'You could have a glorious MacDonalds couldn't you?'

Barry: 'Yeah.
That's right.
Then, you know you wanna start from that and build back out bits'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'you know'

Alan: 'Definitely'

Alan: 'And that's the bar they use.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Yeah.

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'and try and sort'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'of shutter it off in some'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'way.

Alan: 'Well I think'

Barry: 'maybe even getting literally shutters rather than those grills.

Alan: 'Mm.'

Barry: 'I mean we must, they must spend twenty quid a head at the bar'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Anne's just saying we erm ought to pull that whole sta dance floor out and have it all flat floored.'

Hugh: 'Flat.
Yeah.'

Barry: 'And you could then do something that's'

Hugh: 'That's more American anyway.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'And, I mean you can create a dance floor by the tables and just lighting round it.
I mean that's all it, as I say, I don't know why I didn't think of it cos in the she well I do know why I didn't think of'

Alan: 'Why don't we make that like a rebel fort?'

Alan: 'That would be that'

Barry: 'Like the Alamo you mean?'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'The thing blows out of it?'

Alan: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Arrows stuck in it!
Are we erm'

Alan: 'Oh no not at all.'

Alan: 'No, that isn't what I, no, no, no'

Hugh: 'Yeah.'

Alan: 'well as it is now you, you know, you really don't wanna be half of them up there and half of them down here on a table.
And you could get so many in on the thing.'

Hugh: 'I think you have, I, I sort of.'

Barry: 'And then just lino the whole floor.'

Hugh: 'Cos, well the floor can be a disco anyway, like, you know.
It's not a disco, disco, you know what I mean?

Alan: 'No.'

Barry: 'No.
I mean lin'

Alan: 'Yeah, something'

Barry: 'I me'

Alan: 'nearly'

Barry: 'for the sake of, for the sake of a few bands that we do, I mean most of the bands on the local level are used to playing in pubs so they just had to play on the floor anyway and the rest of it'

Alan: 'Well it's a bloody ego who needs the stage [UNK].'

Barry: 'And any, any major names you could always, if you need, if it was that big yo and important'

Alan: 'They'd be at the [UNK] wouldn't they?'

Barry: 'No, but'

Alan: 'Well that'd be'

Barry: 'No but I mean you could get a a stage in'

Alan: 'Pull a stage in.'

Barry: 'stage in from across the er across the way.
Just temporary'

Barry: 'staging that's put in and cast away.'

Alan: 'Well where do you find that?

Hugh: 'Is there no chance of it?'

Alan: 'What, of him getting this back?'

Barry: 'No.
Not now, no not'

Alan: 'Pigs can fly can they!'

Barry: 'now, not Elliel.
Da I mean once he sort of re I mean that's why all the fuss with Jean stopped because that'

Alan: 'Yeah, but a thing like'

Hugh: 'Was it?'

Alan: 'that is, it's just that Mr [UNK] who really didn't know anything from his [UNK] and needle and thread was stirring the shit!'

Alan: 'No, she's been getting enough of that.'

Barry: 'But once he's, once he's resigned himself to that, he's then gotta look at that operation next door and he must be losing money hand over fist for the amount of space it is.'

Hugh: 'That's right.'

Barry: 'He to take out all these walls out, right the way back'

Alan: 'And is it just'

Barry: 'and it's as big as this.'

Alan: 'And you've got'

Barry: 'Not as many as the Dome.
Even, at six hundred.'

Alan: 'Not a quarter.'

Barry: 'Yeah.

Barry: 'Didn't have enough people in to do anything else.'

Hugh: 'I dunno.'

Barry: 'We'd have had, they'd have had to spent about five quid a head.'

Hugh: 'Yeah but they were.

Barry: 'Oh yeah.'

Hugh: 'At least, like.
Well she, I mean, she might have done it.
She should have done a bit more than that actually.'

Like, you didn't serve any drinks did you Barry?'

Barry: 'No.

Hugh: 'So all'

Barry: 'twenty, twenty quid's worth maybe at the end.

We need somebody on to collect glasses.'

Hugh: 'But er, there wasn't really any even though it was quite, we, we, we did have quite a lot of glasses.

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Hugh: 'like.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Oh yeah, I mean, they're gonna have to be from now on cos we're not gonna be, you know, we're gonna be responsible to'

Hugh: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'somebody else, not just ourselves, you know.
Okay, if we wa if we want to turn a blind eye to it then that's our business you know but er but when you're, when you're actually erm'

Hugh: 'Answerable to someone else.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Present accounts to somebody else you can't do it like that can you?
You know water's looking disgusting!

Hugh: 'Er Forest'

Barry: 'The'

Hugh: 'won four two.'

Barry: 'Oh did they?'

Hugh: 'Doing really well.
[UNK]. Liverpool drew one each with Bristol Rovers.'

Hugh: 'I've seen it, seen that one I've seen that match they were lucky.'

Barry: 'Sunderland won, who were they playing?'

Hugh: 'Sunderland won.
Er Oxford I think.
They were winning three nil three two at the end of it.
Oxford scored one on the end [UNK]'

Barry: 'Not many first division teams left is there?'

Hugh: 'Nine.'

Barry: 'About nine is there?'

Hugh: 'Wrexham were unlucky against Blackburn.'

Barry: 'Oh!
Weren't they?
Didn't they play well?'

Hugh: 'Yes!
They've always been a'

Barry: 'I thought they played'

Hugh: 'good club side Wrexham.'

Barry: 'Yeah, they have but I mean, they got a lot of good skilful young lads haven't they?
They're only like nineteen and twenty'

Hugh: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'and I mean that young fullback looked brilliant!
That lef'

Hugh: 'Yeah.
Mm mm.
Quite good.
Composed as well like.
Talented.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
It's a funny law that er clear chance at goal job innit?
I mean it's a funny definition.
I must admit I, I if you could stop that deliberate foul it's I mean it's better for the game if you can stop it.'

Hugh: 'Send them off.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
I mean if you're gonna do it'

Hugh: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'do it, do it, do it'

Hugh: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'consistently.
Cos, actually, the other thing about defenders hauling people down like that, you know, how many times when a forward's through one on one on a goal keeper does he score?
It's not that often actually.'

Hugh: 'No.'

Barry: 'I mean, okay, somebody like Besty'

Hugh: 'Thing you want'

Barry: 'you could bet on'

Hugh: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'nine times out of ten, but'

Hugh: 'But even, even against the goalkeeper they fucking lose fifty percent of the, like'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Hugh: 'I was saying more than fifty percent of the playing'

Barry: 'Yeah, I would, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.'

Hugh: 'And that's all just one on one on the goalkeeper.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Well that's what I mean, I mean, you know, th th the player could let him, could let him go really without deliberately fouling him because it's, it's gonna'

Hugh: 'Half the'

Barry: 'be at least a fifty fifty'

Hugh: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'chance that the goalkeeper's gonna save it innit?'

Hugh: 'It's fucking gotta be straight like that, I, I, I don't fucking taking off three points for a [UNK] [UNK].
At the start it seemed to improve the matches but it, they've just become too hectic now I think.'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Hugh: 'You know, there's not as much skill involved as there was.'

Barry: 'No.
No, that's right.
It's'

Hugh: 'Like the'

Barry: 'incredibly passed.'

Hugh: 'the first, the first season like the football did seem to improve but it's not'

Barry: 'That's right.'

Hugh: 'gonna go back now I think.'

Barry: 'United have got a strange side at the moment though'

Hugh: 'Oh yes.'

Barry: 'I mean I don't think you can it's alright having all these players but if you he doesn't seem'

Hugh: 'They don't play.'

Barry: 'he doesn't seem to'

Hugh: 'They'

Barry: 'have an idea of what he wants.
Cos I mean'

Hugh: 'No they don't.'

Barry: 'every week he's got a different sort of format.'

Hugh: 'Well what's he supposed to do?
[UNK] Giggs, Semen [UNK].'

Barry: 'Well he had him'

Hugh: 'Well I think he's gotta look at, and the team should be in with you'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Hugh: 'like.'

Barry: 'He had him playing yesterday, er, but they dropped Hughes.'

Hugh: 'Yeah I know.
Well you don't drop Hughes for anybody!'

Barry: 'And his two subs, Hughes and Sharp, I mean it does rather hamstring'

Hugh: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'you if anything happens to a central defender dunnit?'

Hugh: 'Yeah.
Well I don't think Hughes should ever be sub like, he should be on the team.'

Barry: 'Well that's right, even if he's not scoring goals he's creating so much pressure and, and'

Hugh: 'Yeah, he always done like.
Good in defence as well.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
That's right.
Well he's also summat, er I mean he's, he's one of the best at holding a ball you know'

Hugh: 'Fantastic shielding the ball'

Barry: 'on his own.'

Hugh: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Hugh: 'Whitbreads are here.
Arsenal'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Hugh: 'They were winning three nil weren't they?'

Barry: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Did you see this goal?'

Hugh: 'No.
I remember seeing, but I heard fucking result on News at Ten.'

Barry: 'It was a long'

Hugh: 'I know.'

Barry: 'it was a it was full pass inside to two fullbacks er, for the Southampton player that was running on this fullback shaded it away you know, guiding him out of it, he's running to the e sa Smeichel came out to the edge of the area but he was like right on the edge as the player was coming to him, so he just let it roll a little bit further, he stopped it with his foot, the guy came and tackled him off got it instead of just picking it up with his hand, I mean he was actually in the area but like he was right on the edge and he took a step back'

Hugh: 'Why the fuck didn't he [UNK]'

Barry: 'and stopped it with his foot.
Yeah.'

Hugh: 'wait for the ball coming in?
I tell you Liverpool were really lucky cos er Bristol Rovers had got a penalty.'

Barry: 'Mm.
As long they, as long as they win the league I do I don't mind.
Been a long time.
Mind you'

Hugh: 'I know.'

Barry: 'Leeds are still bloody doing well though.'

Hugh: '[UNK] They won three nil last week didn't they?'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Oh every week they putting it together, scoring the goals.'

Hugh: 'I think they were about a hundred and fifty to one I'm standing see if they can win the league.'

Barry: 'Are they?'

Hugh: 'Yeah.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
Wouldn't be a bad that actually, cos if it did'

Hugh: 'Yeah, they played well the year before they held their own see they've got all the'

Barry: 'They played last year didn't they?'

Hugh: 'the best lads.'

Barry: 'Yeah.
I mean they're, they ended up about what were they, about fifth or something weren't they?'

Hugh: 'Yeah, last year.

Barry: 'And they bought er players didn't they?
They put, you know, started to buy a few you know, like Dorego and things like that.
Wallace not a bad buy.'

Hugh: 'Arsenal are playing terrible aren't they?'

Barry: 'Mm.'

Hugh: 'Roecastle's started to play well again this'

Barry: 'Yeah.
It was an awful goal that United gave away weren't it?'

Barry: 'We I mean, it was only Palaster in, in that half.
And where the hell the fullbacks were!'

Hugh: 'In wonderland.'
