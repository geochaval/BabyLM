Stuff like Mega C D and all that's, gonna come out, which is good, probably gonna be better than the twelve hundred.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'That's why I'm not sure if I'd buy the twelve hundred.'

[UNK]: 'What apart from the C D [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'The twelve hundred's good [UNK] The twelve hundred's good, yeah, but until the game, the good games start coming out, until they programme it.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'cousins in Japan so he sends them games but, you can [UNK] them if you want.'

[UNK]: 'Right, like I said, I'd be a bit cautious of getting a twelve hundred.'

[UNK]: 'Why?'

[UNK]: 'I don't know, I mean, loa, new computers come out all the time.'

[UNK]: 'Nothing to beat the twelve hundred.'

[UNK]: 'Shh, yeah.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, that that's what I'm saying.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, like the five hundred [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Even though there was better technology, still [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, look how stupid [UNK] were.
He [UNK] five hundred which was a good [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'And then it went five hundred plus.'

[UNK]: 'Exact five hundred plus.'

[UNK]: 'Have you looked it.'

[UNK]: 'Even the five hundred'

[UNK]: 'There almost the same.'

[UNK]: 'Even the five hundred plus is [UNK] the same as the five hundred.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, I know, I know it is.'

[UNK]: '[UNK] difference is.
Then they go to the stupid six hundred which is the same as that.'

[UNK]: 'Exactly, exactly, so what you're gonna, you're gonna keep waiting until, it's, it's gonna keep coming out, so you'll have to buy twelve hundred.'

[UNK]: 'So you'll [UNK] twenty-two hundred for [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'In the, in the be between the twelve hundred and the four thousand.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, four megabyte four megabyte.'

[UNK]: 'Get that.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, that's [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'How much difference is that gonna be?'

[UNK]: 'What's the difference gonna be?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, but I think you gotta make [UNK] specifically.'

[UNK]: 'Well, it's gonna be faster [UNK].'

[UNK]: 'So, you can make it faster, you don't really need it faster.'

[UNK]: 'Are they gonna make it specifically'

[UNK]: 'About thirty megabytes, 'cos it's twic it's be, it's processing being doubled compared to a th a normal'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, I [UNK] that.'

[UNK]: 'So it's gonna be about thirty megahertz.'

[UNK]: 'I worked out about thirty-three [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'It's good'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'But what I'm saying is, be a bit careful.'

[UNK]: '[UNK] where to find one.
What you gonna d right if they bring out a twelve hundred plus, so what.'

[UNK]: 'Twelve hundred plus.'

[UNK]: 'That's gonna be, hardly any difference.'

[UNK]: 'C Ds.'

[UNK]: 'No, I hope they might make a new [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, but C D T V Two, is only, it's only'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'Does it have a keyboard.'

[UNK]: 'You sure.'

[UNK]: 'No, it's a console.'

[UNK]: 'Console, C D.'

[UNK]: 'You probably could get a keyboard, but'

Oh.'

[UNK]: '[UNK] background, I don't understand that about you're probably dazzled, you're probably dazzled by, it might slow down, because de-programming has probably just took the old one, and just made it'

While you're waiting for the kettle to boil erm, get a cup from the cupboard and a tea bag from the tea jar, put tea bag in the the cup and then wait for the kettle to boil and o, once the kettle has boiled you put your hot water into the cup and le, and let the tea brew for a little while And then, after you let it brew you can either add milk to it or, do not add milk to it.

But, and now, and now we're gonna go to the things what parents have wrong, like their, like, they spoil their child and everything at home.
Or, here's a letter that was sent to me by Teresa [UNK] from Birmingham.
Dear Anthony, our five year old son, our five year old daughter is a very bad loser.
When we play games with her sh, and she doesn't win she either gets upset and cries or gets angry.
We've trying showing her that we don't mind when we lose but it doesn't seem to work work.
Any ideas?
Well yeah, for, we, what I will say to you is, try giving her a surprise, when you when you or the father lose again you should react by getting upset or angry.
This is serious suggestions, often children can learn from seeing themselves as others see them.'

Anthony: 'When you get angry about losing your husband can, yo ha, losing your husband can ask for his wife, from your daughter about how to deal with it?
Do this lightly so you can so she can see you're you are acting and doesn't get frightened.
Yet, seriously enough so she hasn't had she hasn't, so she has an opportunity to put herself in your shoe.
If you feel this too much to do for you, stick to what you are, are already doing.
Don't pay close attention to the detail.
What happens, when you do show her you mind losing what do you next, what do you do next?
And how can you tell her you don't want to play any more games or, if you analyse her reactions carefully you'll see how some encourage encouraging, that changes your looking, for you, for you're likely to find she begins to, to modify her behaviour.
That was from Teresa [UNK] from Birmingham.
Now I wanna go onto a Dear Anne one, which is very interesting.
Hold on.
Right.
Dear Anne, can I give him up?
I'm divorced forty ye, I'm a divorced forty year old woman with two grown up children and I am in a terrible situation.
The thing is that my infa, infatuated with my bo with my daughter's boyfriend who is also my son's best friend.
It started when I, when I came home drunk after his, like, [UNK].
He was started flirting with me saying how older women turn [UNK] on.
I was flattered.
And one thing led to another.
Af, I thought that first time would be the last, but since this, Steve's been dropping in during the day while my son and daughter are at work.
I know this sorried affair is wrong, that I end up breaking my daughter's heart, or upsetting my son, son's ha, but I don't think I can give up Steve?
Am I feeling desperate?
Can you help?
Well one thing is fucking kick him out!

And there's another one.

How can someone my age learn to swim.
Summer is coming this year and I really want to learn.'

Anthony: 'Well, what you do is you go to your nearest leisure centre and ask if you could do the training classes for the adults who can't sa, who can't swim yet.

Kevin: 'three types of industry.
Any job which sector for example would running a hotel come in?
Running a hotel, which sector would it come under?
Right, these are sector.
What's a sector in mathematics please?'

Anthony: 'The area.'

Kevin: 'Well, well, a'

Anthony: 'area.'

Kevin: 'a, a part, yeah.
These are three types of primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors, so give me which sector is the hotel industry in?'

[UNK]: 'Secondary?'

Kevin: 'No.
Do you make hotels?'

Kevin: 'So, what do you do when you go to a hotel?
You stop there don't you?
So, what sector is it?'

[UNK]: 'Tertiary.'

Kevin: 'Tertiary.
Cos it's providing a service.'

[UNK]: 'Service.'

Kevin: 'If you go on holiday and there aren't any hotels, you're gonna be sleeping outside with the stars.'

Anthony: 'You'll be back again.'

Kevin: 'Can you give me an example of the electrician.'

[UNK]: 'Service.'

Kevin: 'Which sector is the electrician in?'

Anthony: 'Service.'

Kevin: 'Service.
Which i, which sector is the house builder in?'

[UNK]: 'Secondary.'

Kevin: 'Secondary.
Cos he's ma making houses.
Which sector is the lawyer in?'

[UNK]: 'Tertiary.'

Kevin: 'Tertiary.
Which sector is the research assistant in a laboratory.'

[UNK]: 'Primary.'

Kevin: 'No.'

[UNK]: 'Sectors?'

[UNK]: 'Secondary.'

Patrick: 'Tertiary.'

Kevin: 'No.'

[UNK]: 'Well, secondary.'

Kevin: 'No.'

Kevin: 'They're in the quaternary sector.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah, sir, you know you said the house builders are secondary if they're making something, they're also providing a service though aren't they?'

Kevin: 'But tha, well so is the person who makes shoes.
Cos if we didn't have somebody making shoes we'd all be walking round bare foot.
See what I mean?'

[UNK]: 'Yep.'

Kevin: 'Yeah?
A person who's make tables, yeah?
He's providing a service but in th the prime role, yeah?'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Kevin: 'Okay?
The person is'

Kevin: 'who, for example, who makes medicine yeah?
He's in the manufacturing industry but they're providing a service.
Yeah?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'The person who sells the house yeah?'

[UNK]: 'So if he sells he's tertiary.'

Kevin: 'Is the tertiary.
quaternary sector you do not need to know about.
Okay?
But quaternary sector is anybody who's into research or er high international finance and banking.
Yeah?
It's a new one that's only just been around for the last fifty years.
Okay?
But just for your information.
You do not need to know that.
But most jobs all jobs in fact could be divided into these sectors.
Because you could say international banking could go into the ser, tertiary sector.'

Anthony: 'Sir?
Is this for the key stage three what we're doing?'

Kevin: '.
No.'

Anthony: 'Oh that's alright then.'

Kevin: 'We're not doing that.'

Kevin: 'You don't come under key stage until you go into wa er er year eight I think it is.
Okay?
Right, so these are the three sectors.
Now, there are three types of country and these are types of country.'

Kevin: 'Right.'

Anthony: 'Boy!'

Kevin: 'Now then the way that you categorize countries what do I mean categorize?'

Patrick: 'Well catori'

[UNK]: 'Put them in order.'

Kevin: 'Put them them into, not order that's rank, a different'

[UNK]: 'Like primary, secondary and'

Kevin: 'Put into'

Anthony: 'Sir.'

Kevin: 'different categories.'

Anthony: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Anthony: 'Like, for what they're good at'

Kevin: 'Well'

Anthony: 'developing'

Kevin: 'Okay.'

Anthony: 'or whatever.'

Kevin: 'Now then'

Kevin: 'a country that has less developed countries'

Kevin: 'have this is a graph now, yeah?'

Kevin: 'Less developed countries sit down quickly boy.
Less developed countries have some primary industry.
They have very little'

Kevin: 'secondary industry but they have even less tertiary.
Now this is based on area, for example, d'ya remember we looked at'

Kevin: 'what's this country?'

[UNK]: 'Brazil.'

Kevin: 'Brazil.
Which part is the rich'

[UNK]: 'North Brazil.'

Kevin: 'which part is rich?'

[UNK]: 'South part.'

[UNK]: 'South'

Kevin: 'South.
So here there is service and there is some'

Anthony: 'Manufacturing.'

Kevin: 'manufacturing.
It's changing because of the, what project?'

Anthony: 'Environment.'

Kevin: 'In the north there isn't.
Okay?
There is'

Kevin: 'a lot more primary.
What primary activities are happening in the northern part of Brazil.'

[UNK]: 'Mining.'

[UNK]: 'The cutting down of trees.'

Kevin: 'The cutting down of trees.
What else?'

Anthony: 'Farming.'

Kevin: 'Farming.
What else?'

Anthony: 'Coal mining.'

[UNK]: 'Mining.'

Kevin: 'Right.
They do some man, this is increasing.
But it's only happening in some less developed countries.
Can anybody say why it's happening in so, some countries?
You know I said jobs are divided into primary, secondary, tertiary, some, all countries can divide, can divide it up into less developed, developing, and developed.
So tell me then, why do only some less developed countries have primary industries.'

Patrick: 'Cos they ain't got the companies to build up the'

Kevin: 'No.'

Patrick: 'things.'

Kevin: 'Not the companies.'

Anthony: 'They ain't got the'

[UNK]: 'People.'

Kevin: 'No.'

Anthony: 'I was gonna say they ain't got the things to do it.'

Kevin: 'No.
They haven't got any coal.
They haven't got any trees.
For example, a country that's in the da, in the desert with no'

Anthony: 'India.'

Kevin: 'trees.'

Anthony: 'India.'

Kevin: 'No fish.
No land to farm.
Yeah?
And, and no mines or minerals underneath the ground, can that have a lot of primary industry?'

[UNK]: 'No.'

Kevin: 'No.
So there's some countries in the desert around the Gobi desert that don't have any primary industry.
Do you understand that?
Yes?
Now they have some secondary industry.
Cos every country has to make some sort of farming tools, has to make some plates, you know you've seen photographs and you've seen pictures, some countries all have some sort of factory.
They don't have big factories like they have at Dagenham, but small, what I call almost they are called these.'

Kevin: 'Cottage industries.
What do you think I mean by cottage industries?'

[UNK]: 'A small [UNK].'

Kevin: 'Small.
You know what a cottage is, it's a small house.
These are small industries.
Remembering, of course, that there will be some big industries, this is just general, okay?
If you think of a less developed country, you might find some big industry, this is just a way to divide the [UNK].
Now then, developing countries have much more raw materials industry, and that is still increasing.
They have more secondary, and they have more area but it's still spatial.
Because Brazil is an example of a developing country.'

[UNK]: '[UNK] would use that much mining now, it's small [UNK].'

Kevin: 'Well because what they do is what do you think they do with the goods they dig out the ground?'

[UNK]: 'They don't use it?'

Kevin: 'It's mostly for'

[UNK]: 'Export.'

Kevin: 'export.'

Kevin: 'Same as here, this is for'

Kevin: 'export.
And this, is just beginning.
And it's mostly multi-national companies that run it.
Okay?
Finally, a developed country has'

Kevin: 'much less primary.
Carl.
Has a lot more secondary, but it is changing.
Do we now, for example, make er big ships like we used to?'

Anthony: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'No.'

Kevin: 'No.
We make a lot of computers and things like that don't we?
Changing the what we make or manufacture.
What do, gimme an example of a multi-national country, multi-national company in a developing country that makes things?'

[UNK]: 'Sanyo.'

Kevin: 'What?
Sanyo.'

[UNK]: 'Yes.'

Kevin: 'Where are they made?
Where are, where are Nike trainers made?'

[UNK]: 'Nike.'

Anthony: 'Area, er America.'

[UNK]: 'Korea.'

Kevin: 'Yeah.
They're made in Korea.
Yeah?
That is a developing country, but it's a multi-national company.
What's a multi- national company Craig?'

[UNK]: 'Er'

Kevin: 'Look at the word.
It's company that's got bases in'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.
All over the'

Kevin: 'Yeah, many different countries.
Have you seen the er what's the advert with the globe?
Is it I C I or B P?'

[UNK]: 'Reebok.'

Kevin: 'No.
The globe.'

Kevin: 'I C I.'

Patrick: 'Yeah, the one with erm cream on it's face.
That one.'

[UNK]: 'Erm, where [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'That's a toothpaste ad though.'

[UNK]: 'British Airways sir, is it?'

Kevin: 'No.
Mu, British Airways is a multi-national company.'

[UNK]: 'I C I is.'

Kevin: 'I C I is.'

Patrick: 'It's I C I.'

Kevin: 'Yeah?
You got o, I C I.'

[UNK]: 'Er, [UNK].'

Kevin: 'Okay.'

[UNK]: 'No it's not.'

Kevin: 'But we have a lot'

Anthony: 'American Express sir?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'American Express!'

Kevin: 'Yeah.'

Anthony: 'Shows you on there.'

Kevin: 'Is a multi- national'

Kevin: 'company.
It is a multi-company.
Yeah.
You're right.
We have a lot of tertiary.
Now these what do you think the E stands for?'

[UNK]: 'Everything.'

[UNK]: 'Export.'

[UNK]: 'Sorry.'

[UNK]: 'Engage.'

Kevin: 'No, think!'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'We don't export some tertiary services do we?'

[UNK]: 'Exchange.'

Kevin: 'Exchange things.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'E equals'

[UNK]: 'I don't know.'

Anthony: 'Enterprise.'

Kevin: 'No.'

[UNK]: 'I don't know.'

Kevin: 'Employ in that sector.'

[UNK]: 'Employee.'

Kevin: 'Okay?
So the number of people'

Kevin: 'in the country employed in that sector.'

Kevin: 'About a hundred, two hundred years ago we had ninety five percent of people i in this country were employed in farming.
Now, these countries have ninety five percent, and they will gro, gradually grow into a developed country.
Do you remember last year when we had the population graph that went like that?'

Anthony: 'Well yeah, the birth rate.'

Kevin: 'And in nineteen fifty in U K'

[UNK]: 'It started to rise.'

Kevin: 'Yeah?
Nineteen fifty in Brazil was exactly where it was eighteen fifty for the U K.
Do you remember?
Compared the two graphs.
Okay?
So now you understand levels of development.
There are three levels of development, what are they Richard?'

[UNK]: 'Less developed, developing, and'

Kevin: 'Okay.'

[UNK]: 'developed.'

Kevin: 'And e, do you understand this?
Yeah?'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'Right.
Going back to this.
Because when you come to write this up you need to include this.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'Okay.'

Kevin: 'Physical environment.'

Kevin: 'And there you have your third type'

Patrick: 'coming up.
You have, sorry, would you'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'okay you have, what's geology please?'

[UNK]: 'Geography.'

Kevin: 'No!
Otherwise it would have written geography on there!'

Kevin: 'It's like saying what's a Ford?
It's actually'

Kevin: 'Ford Fiesta.'

Anthony: 'Sir.
Is it like looking up something?'

Kevin: 'Geology'

Kevin: 'is rocks.'

[UNK]: 'You got rocks in there [UNK].'

Patrick: 'Sir, some rocks have got hole in it, you know that?'

[UNK]: 'You know?'

Kevin: 'Right.'

Kevin: 'Okay?
So the first thing in geology, why is geology important?'

Anthony: 'Cos you got'

Kevin: 'What the rock is like?'

Anthony: 'cos you got materials in it that we need.'

Kevin: 'Yeah.
Like tin, or iron, or gold or even'

[UNK]: 'Minerals.'

[UNK]: 'Erm'

Anthony: 'Zinc.'

Kevin: 'oil.'

[UNK]: 'Gold.'

Kevin: 'Or zinc, any of those.
Right.
Climate?'

Patrick: 'Weather.'

Kevin: 'Why is that important please?
Which sector really might the climate and weather help?'

[UNK]: 'Er'

[UNK]: 'Primary.'

Kevin: 'Primary.
Why?'

[UNK]: 'Cos it's farming.'

[UNK]: 'To grow it.'

Kevin: 'Farming.
Another sector?'

[UNK]: 'Secondary.'

Kevin: 'Why secondary?'

[UNK]: 'Tertiary.'

Kevin: 'Secondary could help because what happens if there's a lot of water?
You could put a hydro-electric dam up there which could help electricity, which could help your industry.
Yeah?
And finally, tertiary sector, why is climate and weather useful for tertiary sector?
Why is climate, what happens when it's really, really hot?'

[UNK]: 'You got fans.'

[UNK]: 'People go away [UNK].'

Kevin: 'What do you mean you gotta buy fans?
No.
People go'

[UNK]: 'on holiday.'

Kevin: 'People go on holiday there.'

Kevin: 'Okay?'

[UNK]: 'Get the fans out.'

Kevin: 'The next section.'

[UNK]: 'Animals and plants.'

Kevin: 'Animals and plants, is obviously to do with'

[UNK]: 'Tertiary.'

[UNK]: 'Farming.'

Kevin: 'farming, because, for example, you can't keep er er strawberries in the cold.'

Patrick: 'Because they'd die.'

Kevin: 'You ought to be a farmer when you grow up.'

Kevin: 'You'd make a fortune.
Okay.
And the fourth sector.'

[UNK]: 'Shops.'

Kevin: 'No.'

Kevin: 'Scenery, landscape.
Why is that important please?'

Anthony: 'So like you're not'

[UNK]: 'Sir.'

Anthony: 'damaging the environment.'

Kevin: 'Pardon?'

Anthony: 'Not, yo, you're not damaging the environment.'

[UNK]: 'What?'

[UNK]: 'People come'

Kevin: 'No.
This is a picture of a map of Japan.'

[UNK]: 'Is it?'

Kevin: 'Yeah.'

Anthony: 'Looks like a gu water pistol.'

Kevin: 'All of Japan'

Kevin: 'inside'

[UNK]: 'There's no environment'

Kevin: 'The brown'

[UNK]: 'there.'

Kevin: 'is mountain.
Can you build cities on top of the mountains?'

[UNK]: 'No.'

Kevin: 'Can you build factories on top of the mountains?'

[UNK]: 'No.'

Kevin: 'Most of the mountains are all volcanoes anyway.
There's a lot of earthquakes there.
So most of your cities'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

[UNK]: 'There aren't any.'

Anthony: 'Are round the edge of it.'

Kevin: 'Around the edge of it.'

Patrick: 'Sir, where's the wall then?'

Kevin: 'Where's the'

Patrick: 'The wall.'

Kevin: 'The wool?'

Patrick: 'Yeah the wall.'

[UNK]: 'What wall?
The great wall?'

Patrick: 'They gotta wall.'

[UNK]: 'Great wall of China?'

[UNK]: 'China's not in Japan.'

Kevin: '[UNK].'

[UNK]: 'They got a wall!'

Kevin: 'Okay.
Let's move on.'

Kevin: 'Okay.
Yeah, there are flat'

[UNK]: 'The building's [UNK].'

Kevin: 'Yeah.
And soil.
Why is soil important?'

[UNK]: 'So you can grow more resources.'

[UNK]: 'Cos farming involves the crops.'

Kevin: 'What?'

[UNK]: 'So you grow more resources.'

Kevin: 'No you can't. [UNK] the what?'

[UNK]: 'Crops.'

Kevin: 'Farming.'

[UNK]: 'Farming.'

Kevin: 'Crops, yeah.
Okay.'

Kevin: 'Now then the physical environment leads onto those three types of resources and they are renewable'

Anthony: 'Aha.'

Kevin: '[UNK], what, what's [UNK] mean?
What have we been'

Kevin: 'calling it?'

Kevin: 'Not renewable. [UNK] sounds like finish which means that eventually they will'

Anthony: 'Die.'

Kevin: 'run out.
Give me an example of a renewable resource please?'

[UNK]: 'Trees.'

Kevin: 'Renewable!'

Anthony: 'Paper.'

Kevin: 'No.'

[UNK]: 'Sir!'

Kevin: 'Actual resource, come on.'

[UNK]: 'Coal.'

Kevin: 'Renewable!
Once you burn coal die, it's dead.'

[UNK]: 'Oil.'

[UNK]: 'Water.
Plastic.'

Kevin: 'Water.'

[UNK]: 'Water.'

Kevin: 'Yes, whe when you go to farmers grow plastic trees.'

Kevin: 'In the future, yeah. [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Coal.'

Kevin: 'Seen it'

[UNK]: 'Water, coal.'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Kevin: 'New word for you aesthetic.
Have you ever come across that in'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'art?'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Anthony: 'Nah.'

Kevin: 'Aesthetic means, it means, it is very much like the, everybody wants to look at it.'

Anthony: 'Alright sir.'

Kevin: 'Thought it was you three.
Okay.'

Kevin: 'Factors needed for life?'

[UNK]: 'Residence.'

Kevin: 'Residence.
What's that mean?
Anthony?'

Anthony: '[UNK] for a house where you can live in or'

Kevin: 'A house or a box.
Yes.'

[UNK]: 'A house or box.'

Kevin: 'Okay?
Food, why do we need food?'

[UNK]: 'To keep ourselves alive.'

[UNK]: 'To keep us alive.'

[UNK]: 'Energy.'

Kevin: 'No.
Energy.'

Anthony: 'You don't need it though.'

Kevin: 'Why do we need work?'

[UNK]: 'Exercise.'

Kevin: 'No.'

Anthony: 'So we, so we can our bills.'

[UNK]: 'Money, to get money.'

Kevin: 'Money, leisure.'

Anthony: 'To have fun and exercise.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'Other goods and services.'

Patrick: 'Plumber.'

Kevin: 'No, factors needed for life.
Other goods and services.
Subjects.'

Anthony: 'Shops.'

[UNK]: 'Extras.'

[UNK]: 'Shops.'

Kevin: 'Shops.'

[UNK]: 'Shops.'

Kevin: 'Electricity, T V'

Anthony: 'Bank.'

Kevin: 'station, banks, lawyers, accountants, that sort of thing.'

[UNK]: 'Health.'

Kevin: 'Why do we need health?'

[UNK]: 'So we don't die.'

[UNK]: 'To look after li our bodies.'

[UNK]: 'To stay alive.'

Kevin: 'Otherwise you're dead.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'Movement.
What does it mean here in terms of movement?
They don't mean going dancing.'

[UNK]: 'Erm, you [UNK]'

[UNK]: 'Keep kicking ya.'

Kevin: 'No.'

[UNK]: 'Transport.'

[UNK]: 'And keeping'

[UNK]: 'And [UNK]'

Kevin: 'Transport of people.
Good.
Cathy.
And'

[UNK]: 'Movements.'

Kevin: 'movements'

Kevin: 'of residence.'

[UNK]: 'What?'

Kevin: 'What?'

[UNK]: 'The same as you do for planting'

[UNK]: 'trees.'

[UNK]: 'I can see it now [UNK].'

Kevin: 'Information technology and ideas'

Patrick: 'T V.'

[UNK]: 'Oh'

[UNK]: 'Computers'

Kevin: 'Computers'

[UNK]: 'Telephone'

Kevin: 'and'

[UNK]: 'and video'

Kevin: 'telephone and improvement in'

Anthony: 'Compact disc.'

Kevin: 'technology.
What happened if there are improvements in technology in the industry?'

[UNK]: 'No more workers.'

Kevin: 'Right.
Okay.
All these things provide economic systems.
Agricultural, industrial, and service.
Are they the same as pra, are, are they the same as primary, secondary, and tertiary.'

[UNK]: 'Yeah.'

Kevin: 'No!'

Anthony: 'No.'

[UNK]: 'No.'

Kevin: 'Daniel!'

Anthony: 'Er er'

[UNK]: 'er er er!'

Kevin: 'Agricultural is not coal mining unless you eat coal!'

Kevin: 'Ah?
Industrial.
Okay?
These are systems.
One provides us with food, one provi, puts bits together and the other provides us with a service.
Okay?
Then there is the cycle as you can see.
Those three factors there, human, physical, and systems go together into that circle there.
Carl, you'll be writing this up and you won't be able to do it!
Those are individual, locational decisions.
What do we mean by that?
Individual locational decisions.
Well look back to the factors needed for life first of all.
People decide where they're gonna live and what they're gonna live in.
People decide what food they want, what to buy.
People decide where they're gonna work, or have no, that sorted out.
People decide what leisure facilities they're gonna use.'

Kevin: 'People decide what other systems they're gonna have, for example, people I know still won't buy a television, or a video, or a satellite dish, or a microwave.
Right?
They won't do it.
They don't want to have that.
Yes?
People decide whether to opt into the health service or'

Anthony: 'Doctors.'

[UNK]: 'BUPA.'

Kevin: 'or BUPA.'

Kevin: 'Spit it out.
Movement.
People decide whether to use public transport, buy a car'

[UNK]: 'Go on the bus.'

Anthony: 'Bus.'

Kevin: 'move house, move country, move region.'

[UNK]: 'How d'ya move a country?'

Kevin: 'What?'

[UNK]: 'How d'ya move a country?'

Kevin: 'No move from a country'

Kevin: 'from one country to another.'

Kevin: 'Okay?'

Kevin: 'These companies decide whether where and when to work, where and when to build.
Why do you think Fords decided to build at Dagenham?'

[UNK]: 'Cos there's lots of space.'

[UNK]: 'It's a city.'

[UNK]: 'A lot of space.'

[UNK]: 'A city.'

[UNK]: 'Spaces.'

Kevin: 'Lots of reasons.
They didn't just say you know, er er er'

Anthony: 'Dagenham Motors.'

Kevin: 'there'

Kevin: 'we'll build there.'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Kevin: 'Do you ever'

Anthony: 'Cos there's'

Kevin: 'does anybody ever watch the news where they say Japanese company decide to locate in Manchester, or whatever.
Yeah?'

[UNK]: 'Mm.'

Kevin: 'No?'

Kevin: 'It should do, Carl'

[UNK]: 'Cos they get a nice profit.'

Kevin: 'You should do Carl!'

[UNK]: 'divvy!'

Kevin: 'You know, not just watch bloody Bart Simpson!'

[UNK]: 'Do I, do I ever.'

Kevin: 'Right?
People, why do people, why do people move to work on the Docklands?'

Anthony: 'Cos they, cos they'

[UNK]: 'Money.'

Anthony: 'live near it.
Or they're quicker.'

[UNK]: 'It's in the city now.'

Kevin: 'No.
[UNK] when you moved here not to pay rent.'

[UNK]: 'Wo oh.'

Kevin: 'There are lots of reasons why people choose.
And then when people choose it creates what's there, a spatial pattern.
And what are spatial patterns?'

[UNK]: 'Areas.'

[UNK]: 'Space patterns.'

Kevin: 'A space pattern.
A pa, a pattern of industry and ri, locations'

Anthony: 'Patterns, sort of a pattern, right.'

Kevin: '[UNK] provides making goods and service available in all areas.
Okay.
Turn the page please.'

Anthony: 'Nig gi gi geria, Nig gi gi eria, Nige, gi gi ria, Niger gi gi ria, Niger gi gi ria.'

Kevin: 'Your work so far has looked at the case studies of three kinds of activities primary, secondary, and tertiary.'

Kevin: 'They all provide jobs for people.'

Kevin: 'They're all interlinked.
How is a farm interlinked please?
Let's if we can do'

Anthony: 'Because you're getting wheat.'

Kevin: 'In fact what we'll do is, we'll stop after we've done this and then your books, I want you to get that diagram down and spirograph down.
Now then here we have a farm, and it is a farm a mixed farm.'

Kevin: 'What do we mean'

Kevin: 'by a mixed farm please?'

[UNK]: 'You've got er animals and you grow wheat.'

Kevin: 'Animals and crops.'

Anthony: 'It's alright, I'm watching.'

Kevin: 'Well, as I said before'

Kevin: 'Okay.'

[UNK]: 'I'm watching.'

Kevin: 'A mixed farm how is that linked to a to the primary industry?
To coal mining?'

Anthony: 'Cos they're digging.'

Kevin: 'No.'

[UNK]: 'But are they?'

Kevin: 'Anthony unless you can say something intelligent shut your bloody mouth!
Right?'

[UNK]: 'Aha.'

Kevin: 'You have to think before you speak.
Engage your brain before your mouth.'

Kevin: 'They should work in harmo'
