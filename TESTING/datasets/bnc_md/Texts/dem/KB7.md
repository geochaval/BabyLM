I mean normally I don't bother with the tokens, I mean I Anyway I paid the cheque and I said to Peter I said oh by the way what about me tokens for me for me toy I said if I get a free one of them I can give it to give it to the grandchildren.
See, Ricky'd like that I'm sure, little Corgi car I said [UNK].

If I had twenty seven quid's worth at fifty P a litre that's fifty two fifty two?
Fifty two litres [UNK] roughly [UNK] so if it was one voucher for fifteen that's three innit?'

Stuart: 'And I think it was six vouchers for for a free'

Ann: 'That's it.'

Stuart: 'free Corgi toy.

And we were dancing on that bit you see.'

Stuart: 'Oh did you?'

Ann: 'There weren't a lot of room but you don't care do you?
When you've'

Stuart: 'Mm [UNK] little dance and [UNK]'

Ann: 'at ten o'clock at night and pub was packed.
People singing with the the group.

Stuart: '[UNK] Stewie in The Loco well huh'

Ann: 'You know everybody.'

Stuart: 'Well not everybody but'

Ann: 'Biggest part.'

Stuart: 'Knew the landlord.

Hallo Stewie, how are you mate!
Bloody hell's that?
Knew his face and I can't remember his damn name.
Gary [UNK]'

Ann: 'Might even have had my Steven in [UNK] wouldn't have known him.'

Stuart: 'Yeah, he would.'

Ann: 'How do you know?'

Stuart: 'Because there wasn't a tall slim ginger-haired chap in [UNK]'

Stuart: 'I did think it, well I did think it was a possibility but I mean'

Ann: 'Probably his mother and father her mother and father had been in there anyway.'

Stuart: '[UNK] there's a little boy there'd be no chance of him going in there anyway.'

Ann: 'Oh no, course not.'

Ann: 'Course not.'

Stuart: 'So'

Ann: 'I'm going soft in the her mum and dad'll probably be in.
That's their regular [UNK] if they were having a country and western they would ask him to do it because he's'

Stuart: 'What's his what's her mum and dad look like?'

Ann: 'He's big.
He's a, such a big fella.
Fat.
Sue's mum's little and fat, nearly as tall as she's broad.
But dad's a [UNK]'

Stuart: 'Maybe they were in the lounge perhaps.'

Ann: 'bigger I mean he he he's at least as tall as you if not bigger and er also'

Stuart: 'Sort of Tom [UNK] size?'

Ann: 'Yeah.
And she's about the same size round but about five foot two..'

Stuart: 'Well I didn't see anybody'

Ann: 'Sue's a big girl.
She's as tall as me and weighs nearly'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'she must weight fourteen, fifteen stone I should think.
Sue's big'

Stuart: 'Well then I certainly didn't see anybody in there looking like that.
I must admit.'

Ann: 'Oh she usually goes after bingo.
They'll probably be in all night and she's just walked up from the bingo and toddle in there.'

Stuart: 'No I didn't see anybody looking like that so I don't know.'

Ann: 'I wouldn't think they'd be in the lounge.
They could be but I wouldn't have thought so.'

Stuart: 'Thursday night anyway I wouldn't, does she go to the Empire [UNK]'

Ann: 'Well I don't really know do I?
Empire.'

Ann: 'Do they have it Wednesday night [UNK] bingo?'

Stuart: '[UNK] Thursday night don't they, bingo?'

Ann: 'Is it Thursday night?
No oh I don't know [UNK].'

Stuart: 'Thursday night not at the Empire.
Wednesday night the Empire, Friday night [UNK].
Thursday night [UNK]'

Ann: 'Oh well she wouldn't be there after the bingo then would she?
Probably went to I know that she does go [UNK].
She [UNK] there most of the evening and she goes to bingo and'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'Cos they live [UNK] down round near Tina's but not like Tina's house, before that off Allard Avenue round the back of Allard Avenue.
Sherwood is it?'

Stuart: 'Sherwood, yeah Sherwood Avenue.'

Ann: 'Yeah.
Yeah they live up [UNK] yeah.
So it's not that far for The Loco really.'

Stuart: 'No just a short walk.'

Ann: 'It's sort of their local type of thing.
[UNK] anyway but Well Ann is going to retire.
I suppose you're gonna have a bottle and a fag.
Mind you, the smell of you I think you've had sufficient bottles but'

Stuart: '[UNK] well [UNK]'

Ann: 'Told you not to drink much.'

Stuart: 'I did n't.'

Ann: 'Ooh.
Perhaps I'd better stop up then.'

Stuart: 'Well I tried not to, but'

Ann: 'What?'

Stuart: '[UNK] Bob said do you want a drink and Ron said do you want a drink and I said to Ron do you want a drink Ron and everyone said do you want a drink and'

Ann: 'You had quite a few.'

Stuart: 'No, not that many.
But er'

Ann: 'But I might as well go to bed.'

Stuart: 'probably erm'

Ann: 'But I might as well go to bed?
And you do realize that this conversation is on a tape recorder?'

Stuart: 'Well I don't mind.'

Stuart: '[UNK] if it is [UNK].
That's what they want.'

Stuart: 'Natural conversations so'

Ann: 'Not sure how natural though'

Stuart: 'I'll have a can of beer and then I'll probably go to bed. [UNK]'

Ann: 'We haven't got any left.
I drunk them.'

Stuart: 'They've gone have they?'

Ann: 'Mhm.'

Stuart: 'Oh.
I'd better have a bottle then.'

Ann: 'I drunk them as well.'

Stuart: '[UNK] Oh you drunk them as well?
Oh.
ah oh now what am I gonna do?'

Ann: 'Without.'

Stuart: 'I'm without.'

Stuart: 'Crafty devil.
Put them round the corner where where I didn't know where they were.'

Ann: 'Falling over now.'

Stuart: 'No I'm not.'

Ann: 'Oh that young couple next door [UNK] ah!'

Stuart: 'Yeah?
They been at it, have they been at it again?'

Ann: 'Oh I wish you'd have been at home, I'd have gone round there.'

Stuart: 'What've they been up to now then?'

Ann: 'Oh god!
She's been screaming.
He's been reckon she must have locked herself up in the dark.
And the only place with a lock on is the bathroom and I reckon they'll blooming knock the blooming door down by the sound of it.'

Stuart: 'Gawd.'

Brian: 'She was screaming, he was swearing.
Running up and down the stairs.'

Stuart: 'What time was this?'

Ann: 'Quarter to ten till about half past ten.
Or half an hour till half past ten [UNK]'

Stuart: 'Well that wouldn't please them next door would it?'

Ann: 'No.'

Stuart: 'Coo. [UNK]'

Ann: 'And and really I mean you can't I'm I'm s I'm saying that you, you can't interfere but by god I'd long for someone to come in and interfere.
I really would have done.
And er er I I could never understand why people that obviously could hear what went on and pretended they never.
I know you don't wanna get involved'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'and this that and the other but people must have heard what went on and and you know the next morning they'd see a black eye and just carry out a normal conversation as though'

Ann: 'and you know they hadn't heard it all and'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'ooh have you had a fall or something?
Then you know I mean they must have [UNK] what was going on oh aye they just completely ignore it.'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'I'd be walking round if I could get around.'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'It were just you know oh it's a nice morning when I'm hanging the washing out as though everything was wonderful you know'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'normal.'

Stuart: 'Yes.'

Ann: 'Ooh I thought he was going to, ooh I felt made me go cold and I I thought if, if I hadn't been here on my own I'd have been very tempted to go round and and say is there anything I can do.
Or I'd have called the police I think.
I weren't sure what I'd have done but'

Stuart: 'Bad as that?'

Ann: 'Oh [UNK].
He was a calling her effing this, swearing oh it was dreadful.
She was screaming and you could hear her crying.
Then you hear, she pounded up the bloody stairs and he was after her and I reckon well the only room with a lock'

Stuart: 'As you say is the bathroom.'

Ann: 'is the bathroom, so she must have been in there cos he's hammering on the door and bashing it and kicking it.
Bloody hell of a row.
Or whether she opened it or whether she was in the front bedroom with something behind the door I dunno but'

Stuart: 'That's his'

Ann: 'and she run back down the stairs and the front door was opening and banging and shutting, whether she run outside or what I don't know what happened, the dog was bloody barking.'

Stuart: 'Oh lord.'

Ann: 'Well it's a wonder Ann and Rita haven't done something about it.'

Stuart: 'Well I say it's er amazing they've not said, said something [UNK]'

Ann: 'And they had company as well there's a car there, blue car.'

Stuart: 'Who Ann and Rita or?'

Ann: 'Or Ann and Rita.
I don't know.'

Stuart: '[UNK] Sally innit?'

Ann: 'I don't know who it was. [UNK]'

Stuart: 'It was Sally if it was a blue e, blue cavalier.
T D O something something something.'

Ann: 'Sally can't drive so it must be some'

Stuart: 'Can't she?'

Ann: '[UNK] Her latest beau I should think, I don't know.'

Stuart: 'Maybe.
Maybe maybe.'

Ann: 'But it was I mean I could hear it over the telly.
I know I don't have the telly on full blast but I could hear it'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'above the telly.
When I first heard the first noise I thought what the bloody hell's that and I turned the sound down.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'Thought bloody hell, put it back up but you could, it was really distressing me cos'

Stuart: 'You knew what was possibly going on.'

Ann: 'Yeah.'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'A woman and that don't s I mean if you're having just an argument it's raised voices but a woman doesn't scream and cry like that unless'

Stuart: 'Unless there's something really'

Ann: 'something awful going on.'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'I mean Ann and Rita reckon they're not married or anything but why the hell does she stay with him then?
She's not got a bloody'

Stuart: 'Well there you go I mean'

Ann: 'she's got no children.
They're only young.
It's her house.
Isn't his.
He couldn't, she bought it without, with her father and'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'and he come and lived with her in it.
Bloody hell.
I know I mean I stayed with him but I had three kids.'

Stuart: 'Gonna say you're you're [UNK]'

Ann: 'I had three kids, where could I go with them?'

Stuart: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Ann: 'If I'd have been on me own I mean that's all I was waiting for, mine to grow up so I could clear off.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'If I'd have been on me own I wouldn't have stopped bloody long.
I mean even if she walks out he doesn't, no court in the land would give him the house if it's hers.
[UNK] evicted and then she could come back again.'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'Well if she went to the police they'd chuck him out.
He has no legal rights to the property.
It's in her name, she's, her father's helping her paid the deposit or something and she clears the mortgage she has no right, he has no right to it all if she went to the police.
They'd just turf him out wouldn't they?'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'Well why stay in a relationship like that?
Don't understand it.'

Stuart: 'Certainly a bit rough, a bit hard.'

Ann: 'Went quiet about half past ten so whether he buggered off out or what I don't know.'

Stuart: 'Mm maybe.'

Ann: 'Certainly the front door was opening and banging and shutting.'

Stuart: 'Say I'm surprised Ann and Rita haven't sort of didn't'

Ann: 'Well banging on the wall probably with all the other banging and'

Stuart: 'May maybe.
Maybe.
They [UNK] part of the banging.'

Ann: 'So much bloody banging going on.'

Stuart: 'Probably part of the banging Ann and Rita.'

Ann: 'And the people on this side [UNK] you don't know how they were reacting as well.
Say, they was a quite young couple.
We don't hear them that much do we?
Mornings is the time I hear them most.
Cos they go out to work at half past eight and you hear them between half past seven and half past eight'

## 018205

Ann: 'There you are I've made you a cup of tea.
Thank you dear.'

Stuart: 'Very kind of you.'

Ann: 'Are you sure you don't want any breakfast?'

Stuart: 'No.'

Ann: 'You want nothing at all?'

Stuart: 'No.'

Ann: 'You'll be hungry.'

Ann: 'Eh?'

Ann: 'What do you mean good?
Don't be silly.
What's the point in getting really hungry.'

Stuart: '[UNK] Had me tea last night and the beer and [UNK] few sandwiches last night.'

## 018206

Ann: 'How would you like that?
Order's not completed you've got to stay till it is.'

Stuart: 'Up yours mate.
I'm going home.
Ten o'clock and that's it.
Or whatever. [UNK]'

Ann: 'Not many would.
[UNK] Very rare.'

Stuart: 'Not often.'

Ann: 'Oh my god!'

Ann: 'I had that yesterday.
What's our post code?'

Stuart: 'P E fourteen seven P G.'

Ann: 'They was looking for it on a list.'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'Said I know it's P fourteen, I don't know the rest of it.
And he looked on a list he had and he put seven something.'

Stuart: 'Seven P G.
I can always remember it.'

Ann: 'Well you're good at remembering numbers.'

Stuart: 'Well yeah but I just think P E fourteen, half of fourteen is seven and then T.
[UNK] G.'

Ann: 'Yes darling.'

Stuart: 'So that's how I remember it.
Funny innit?'

Ann: 'Yes very strange but you are strange.'

Stuart: 'I know yes.'

Stuart: 'Very strange, yeah, very strange.'

Ann: 'You always remember numbers.
Don't you?
Car numbers and telephone numbers and'

Stuart: 'Car numbers I remember more by the letters than the numbers.
Because there are s specific set numbers.
Once I see'

Ann: '[UNK] When they come round at work and says this car blocked in I say oh go and ask Stuart he'll probably know.
Give you a blooming it's a blue something or other and this is the number.
[UNK] Go and ask [UNK].
I said go and Stuart or Bill they, they know most of them.
I wouldn't know one from another.'

Stuart: '[UNK] associated the letters with the car and the letters with the car go together.
And then the numbers, the numbers I don't remember that well.
Some of them I do.
[UNK] now with them changing the the changeover cos they always used to be the letters followed by the numbers.
Now they've got the initial letter followed by the number then the letters.
Rather than so As I say you associate the car and the number together.'

Ann: 'I don't. [UNK]'

Stuart: 'It would probably throw me completely If you [UNK]'

Stuart: 'it would throw me completely if you put, if you changed some of the number plates over.
If you put Tina's number plate on another car and visa versa that would throw, I I'd probably look at it and think you know, oh somebody's got a new car or that looks familiar but it's not the right car so I wouldn't think about it.
Even though I know Tina's is C two one one Y C L if it was on a different car I'd probably look at it and think'

Ann: 'Oh that's not right.'

Stuart: 'it's not right, it's not Tina's.
And so I wouldn't think that that I probably Just a just a trait of personality.'

Ann: 'I wonder how she is if she's at work or at home.'

Stuart: 'Don't really don't really care to tell you the truth in a way but'

Ann: 'Oh that's nice.'

Stuart: 'Well no I care I care if Tina's not well and hope she gets better soon but I don't care if [UNK]'

Ann: 'You don't care about work getting in a muddle'

Stuart: 'I don't care about work and them being in a muddle, no not at all.'

Stuart: 'Let them get on with it.'

Ann: 'That's not very nice.'

Stuart: 'It is.'

Ann: 'No it isn't.'

Stuart: 'Well it is.
Why isn't it?'

Ann: 'Cos it isn't.'

Stuart: 'Well'

Stuart: 'if a lot of others were off we'd have to cope somehow wouldn't we?
So there you go.
Just cos we're off.
And possibly Tina and that is off so they'll just have to struggle on as if we were there and a lot of others were off.
Don't you agree?'

Ann: 'Yes darling.'

Stuart: 'Right.
So what's on the agenda for today?'

Ann: 'Well you know very well.
We are going shopping.'

Stuart: 'Where are we going shopping?'

Ann: 'Whenever you're ready to take me shopping.'

Stuart: 'But where are we going shopping?'

Ann: 'Well probably Wisbech.
No point in going to Lynn if we're going to mum's.'

Stuart: 'No but where?'

Ann: 'Wherever you wish to take me.'

Stuart: 'Where would Ann want to go?'

Ann: 'I don't mind.
Haven't got a lot of choice.
I don't like Tescos at Wisbech cos it's [UNK].'

Stuart: 'Right.'

Ann: 'So it's Gateway Gateway or blooming Rainbow.
Suppose we could go down the Rainbow and have a look at that microwave.
But I'll have to go into town first.
Cos I don't think they'll give me the shopping for nothing and there's no bank down Rainbow.
Well there is, a Co-op bank but I don't think they'll let me have some money out of it.'

Stuart: 'Mm.
Maybe not.'

Ann: 'And seeing as I haven't got an account with them I don't think they'll say well you can have some anyway.'

Stuart: 'No.'

Ann: 'No.'

Stuart: 'And then we're going into town?
Well we've got to go into town'

Ann: 'Got to see the estate agents and see if we can view something today.'

Stuart: 'Mm [UNK]'

Ann: '[UNK] other ones that we are definitely interested in and underneath the ones that we are not so interested in.'

Stuart: 'Yeah [UNK] there's one down, that one down Elizabeth Terrace.
I was just trying to figure out which one it is.
Hundred and twenty.'

Ann: 'I don't know if that isn't erm what they call it who died not long ago?
Hazel's mum's.
Cos perhaps the dad's moved out or you know [UNK].
Quite close to her.
Oh what was her name?
Old Hazel's mother.'

Stuart: 'Hazel's mother.'

Ann: 'The little old lady who went to Salvation Army, always wearing a little hat.
Oh what was her name?
Cos you know her as well.
And I said oh my god she's died and you said oh I know her. [UNK]'

Stuart: 'What used to go to the Salvation Army?'

Ann: 'She was [UNK] to Salvation Army.
Ever so small little lady.
[UNK] or something.
I can remember her kids and I can't remember her name.
Terrible.
Hazel and Terry, mother-in-law's brother Terry fire officer at Wisbech, it's his mother-in-law laws.
And she died not more than a few months ago.'

Ann: '[UNK] Oh it's awful.
It's dreadful I mean quite fond of her.'

Stuart: 'Just trying to think which one it was anyway.'

Ann: 'I think it's her house.'

Stuart: 'Yeah but I'm trying think which one it is.
Cos I say I know that I know Elizabeth Terrace well.'

Ann: 'Yeah I know cos I think you called on her cos you knew her.
When she died you said oh I know her well.'

Stuart: 'Hundred and twenty.
Let's go and have a look.
Oh it's in here somewhere innit?'

Ann: '[UNK] I put a ring round it so I know'

Stuart: 'Oh yeah here we are, hundred and twenty.
Ah the one one in from the end.
Yeah, I know the one now.
One in from the end.'

Ann: 'I think that is her house.
Mind she had a husband but should think he living with one of the kids.'

Stuart: 'Can't think who lived there now.
God, cos I used to call on that one.
[UNK] perhaps.
[UNK] The only trouble down Elizabeth Terrace parking.'

Stuart: 'That's the only trouble.
The only consolation if'

Ann: '[UNK] the college.'

Stuart: 'if that was a possibility or if that became a possibility [UNK] mum only live round the corner.
Not that far away is she?
Few hundred yards.'

Ann: 'She drives.'

Stuart: 'And I could leave the car in her driveway.'

Ann: 'Then there's the college.
Lot of people park in the college.
Don't they?'

Stuart: 'So that is a possi I was just wondering which one it was cos I say I know some of them are a bit you know'

Ann: 'Yeah.'

Stuart: 'a bit dodgy.
I knew there there they had a lot of trouble with one of them but nearer Helen's end.
There was one there that was empty and for a long long while.
The builders started building, knocking it about'

Ann: 'And it fell to bits.'

Stuart: 'And then it'

Stuart: 'and then, no the ran out of money.
The builder ran out of money and the it was just a shell.
You know, nothing in it.
No windows no doors no nothing er you know, completely gutted it to make it all, to renovate it and then ran out of money and then it just stood there completely empty.
And can you imagine a house in the open air in winter?'

Ann: 'Do it a lot of good would it?'

Stuart: 'It wouldn't do it a lot of good, no exactly.'

Ann: 'Woodwork and'

Stuart: '[UNK] exactly.'

Ann: 'and even the brickwork.'

Stuart: 'No.'

Ann: '[UNK] damp and If you get me back to mum's for about three o'clock time at the latest to take her to Osborne House.'

Stuart: 'Well that's what she's that's what she's [UNK] she's, she just sort of she didn't mean it but'

Ann: 'No it [UNK]'

Stuart: 'it was her thought that we were'

Ann: 'Yeah cos I mean you'd probably run her back, rather than her biking.
As I say I mean we, if we could make an appointment say three fifteen or three thirty to see Sefton Avenue.
Cos we'd be up there anyway.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'Wouldn't we?
Before it gets dark and you couldn't see anything anyway.'

Stuart: 'Oh we'd have to go and have a look in the light.'

Ann: 'Well that's it. [UNK]'

Stuart: 'Definitely.'

Ann: 'cos you can't see a lot.
Cos there won't be electricity on.
Anyway you wanna have a good look round [UNK] seriously consider it.
Cos I think now we [UNK] haven't heard from Mr [UNK] and I think that means he's not prepared to take it so he's not bothered about coming.
Yeah?
Is that the way you're reading it?'

Stuart: 'That's the way I'm reading it.
I'm'

Ann: 'Ignore it cos the man might just leave him in there renting it until or when forever it goes up.
But we can't afford it to go up.'

Stuart: 'I'm disappointed that he's not been back'

Ann: 'Yeah I am.'

Stuart: 'to discuss it.'

Ann: 'Yeah I am.'

Stuart: 'And to put the position to him.
Look the market's not very good I know but we're sitting tenants.
We're quite happy to take it on.
We'd like to take it on.
If we leave have you got another tenant to come in?
You're gonna lose two hundred and fifty pound a month.
And a good two hundred and fifty pound a month.'

Ann: 'Exactly.'

Stuart: 'You know, not one that he has any hassle in getting.'

Ann: 'That's it.
He don't have to keep calling and wandering around after us.
[UNK] But I'm not prepared to go on renting it.'

Stuart: 'No no.'

Ann: 'As you say three thousand pound a year that could be paid off a place of our own is is just I mean if [UNK] I have to rent it well I'll have to rent one.
If we can't get anything else and we can't afford anything else we've just got to go on paying it but'

Stuart: 'But'

Ann: 'when there's so much other [UNK]'

Stuart: 'as I say you look at I mean this is two fifty.
You look here in the paper and see how much they are.'

Ann: 'Yeah I know.
Some of them are terrible.'

Stuart: 'You're talking two sixty, two eighty.'

Ann: 'I know.
Three hundred.'

Stuart: 'To let.
Three seventy.'

Ann: 'No!'

Stuart: 'Detached four bedroomed house admittedly.
[UNK] Granary.
Two b two two bed'

Ann: 'That's the one I fancy.
If I went anywhere into another flat, I'd quite fancy going into [UNK]'

Stuart: 'Two bed second floor self-contained flat.
Living room kitchen bathroom twelve months two seventy five unfurnished.'

Ann: 'Mm I know.'

Stuart: 'Armada Close two eighty.
Norfolk Street two eighty.'

Ann: 'Mm I wouldn't I wouldn't go in to Armada Close I don't think.'

Stuart: 'That's furnished.
Six months.
Two eighty.'

Ann: 'Yeah well you see, furnished you see they can charge extra.'

Stuart: 'Norfolk Street [UNK] self-contained principally first floor flat, two bedrooms furnished two eighty.'

Ann: 'I wouldn't want a furnished one now.'

Stuart: 'No, of course not.
But as I say'

Ann: 'I know they are expensive.
Which is why I [UNK]'

Stuart: 'Two sixty [UNK] two eighty which is the same price as [UNK]'

Ann: 'which, which is why now er that Rose and Jean when they considered it.
Mum said how about renting one in Wisbech but I said well if she can't afford a mortgage you can't afford to rent one.
Not anything that's worth living in.'

Stuart: 'No.'

Ann: '[UNK] fifty quid a week ones are er forty pound a week and so on.
You gets what you pay for which nowadays isn't a lot, not for that money.
You know when I asked, was gonna have er on Lynn Road there what was that fifty a fifty a week?
I mean it was'

Stuart: 'Fifty or fifty five weren't it?'

Ann: 'it was clean but that's about all you could say.'

Stuart: 'Is that the one Ann [UNK] is in now?
Or in that area.'

Ann: 'I don't know where Ann [UNK] is.
No I think she's down Victoria Road somewhere.
She won't tell anybody.
But I think she lives somewhere down Victoria Road.
I don't know.
She's only in a bedsit.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.
But I mean you see her up town though.'

Ann: 'I know.
That's cos she's lonely and she just wanders about.
She gets up'

Ann: 'don't want to stay in the bedsit.
One room [UNK] she she shares a bathroom and kitchen.
She just goes for a walk.
I mean she's seeing people and'

Stuart: 'Yeah but I mean the times I've seen her it's been this end of town rather than that end of town.
Which has made, which which just makes me think'

Ann: 'I don't really, I just presume she lives down Victoria Road somewhere but I don't really know.'

Stuart: 'And she walks to work.'

Ann: 'She couldn't do any other.
She hasn't got a vehicle, she can't afford one.'

Stuart: 'No no.
But that just makes me think why, that's what makes me think she's living [UNK].'

Ann: 'She could be.
But that weren't a bedsitter that I was in [UNK].
Shared bathroom but I'

Stuart: 'No [UNK] but yeah'

Ann: 'but it was a kitchen and bedroom and living room.
They're only tiny like an alcove bedroom but'

Stuart: 'Oh yeah I've been in one of them.
You know I've seen them.'

Ann: 'I mean it was the only one with a with its own kitchen.
The one that I was gonna have.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'This was right up the top and there were a tiny attic bedroom thing was made into a not very salubrious but it had a cooker and a sink.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'And as I say that was fifty or something a week and it wasn't wasn't worth it really.'

Stuart: 'No.'

Ann: 'Furniture wasn't that posh but then er but the only thing I thought about it was safe and it was clean.
Needed a bit of personalizing but it was it was old-fashioned furniture but it was polished.
It was clean.
Had a reasonable carpet on the floor and, and so on.'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'But it wasn't worth fifty pound a week.
Definitely not.'

Stuart: 'But that's what they're going for though isn't it?
If they can get them for that [UNK]'

Ann: '[UNK] people do [UNK].
People are desperate to buy and they'll have whatever and they have to pay.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'When you think that one [UNK] what was thirty three thousand two hundred and sixty a month or something wasn't it?
Well that's gonna be about two hundred and forty, two hundred and fifty a month for that one down [UNK].
Cos thirty three worked out two sixty didn't it?'

Stuart: 'Oh the mortgage you mean?'

Ann: 'Mortgage.
So you can say two hundred and fifty pound a month to buy a place.'

Stuart: 'Oh yeah.'

Ann: 'And yet they want two eighty to rent one.
Seems quite ridiculous.'

Stuart: 'Well that's if you're prepared to buy a flat.
That's the only thing isn't it?
If you're prepared to buy a flat.'

Ann: 'Yeah but at least you've got, actually got the property haven't you?
You're not just paying somebody else to have a Cos if you're moving if you can't sell it you can always rent it again.
Which is what a lot of people are doing [UNK] houses especially.
They buy a house cos they've had a child or something.
They can't afford to they can't sell that one so they rent that out which pays the mortgage for it and start again on another mortgage.'

Stuart: 'You've got to be a bit careful when you're renting out though.'

Ann: 'Oh yes.
Got to be careful of your tenants.
[UNK] pay.'

Stuart: 'Tenants.'

Ann: 'That's why it's best to go through an agency or er something like White and Eddies because they have people that collect them and they have people who have to take up references and'

Stuart: 'Yeah but not only that but I mean if you'

Ann: 'And they have they have proper leases.
I mean after that they're out and'

Stuart: 'Yeah.
well I mean all, all well it counts towards your income as well.'

Ann: 'Oh yeah I know.
Oh yeah income tax on it.'

Stuart: 'Counts counts towards your income.'

Ann: 'But a lot of people are doing it.'

Stuart: 'Mm.
Oh I know.
Well there's [UNK] for one.
[UNK] sell [UNK]'

Ann: 'Lot of people are doing it because they just can't well circumstances.
It's either the job or something means they've gotta go away or they can't afford, they can't sell them so they [UNK] I don't know if that would make your income different if you were still paying a mortgage [UNK].'

Ann: 'Even though your, all the money'

Stuart: 'Think [UNK]'

Ann: 'you were getting in was getting paid out again?'

Stuart: 'I think you'll find it counts towards your income.
So I mean if you had a job'

Ann: 'Paying them more tax.'

Stuart: 'You, you got a job say you're earning'

Ann: 'But I think the expenses when you're'

Stuart: 'earning ten thousand a year.
And you're going, you're getting two hundred and fifty pound a month as well in rent'

Ann: 'Yeah but you, you'd be able to claim expenses.'

Stuart: 'I think so, yeah.'

Ann: 'You wouldn't pay the whole of it taxable if it was you know you would claim expenses for one thing and another.'

Stuart: 'Oh I don't know but I mean I wouldn't have thought so.
Yeah.'

Ann: 'Otherwise probably that's why they are dear because they have to do things like that. [UNK]'

Stuart: 'That's probably why they're the price they are, two eighty.'

Ann: 'That's it.'

Stuart: 'Because people take [UNK]'

Ann: 'Pay fifty and thirty quid a week more is a bloody what they get stopped off them.'

Stuart: '[UNK] and people have taken out big mortgages like Tina.
And to pay off the mortgage they've got to charge so much [UNK]'

Ann: 'I mean Tina's got that little house.
I mean now you'd get it two hundred and fi, I mean Tina pays two hundred and forty eight er pound a week, a month.
Three hundred and forty eight pound a month mortgage on that little house.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'I mean that was bloody thirty nine thousand, or was it forty one when she had it.
It was'

Stuart: 'I know.'

Ann: 'forty one I think.
I mean now they're going for thirty two.
We can afford one like that.'

Stuart: 'Yeah we could [UNK] isn't it?'

Ann: 'Mm.
They don't sell now.
Not selling at all.
There's a few renting now cos they can't sell them.
So It's a nice enough little house but I'm not awfully keen on it are you?'

Stuart: 'I don't like the, I don't like the bedroom'

Ann: 'No I don't'

Stuart: 'situation for one.'

Ann: 'If it had a door and a wall and'

Stuart: 'You're just straight upstairs and you fall into bed.'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'Handy I suppose but'

Stuart: 'In some respects but I mean it just doesn't I mean in a way I suppose well with Tina being a non smoker and Wiggie being a non smoker'

Ann: 'It's not so bad.'

Stuart: 'isn't so bad but, I mean if you're like us and I mean the smoke's just'

Ann: 'That's it.
That's why Tina doesn't like people smoking in her house because it gets into her bedroom.'

Stuart: 'Yes.
Exactly.
The smoke would just rise straight up and'

Ann: 'Yeah.'

Stuart: 'straight up into the bedroom.
I mean she doesn't smoke anyway so I mean you know'

Ann: 'She doesn't like people smoking in her house.
Because she says I don't want my bedroom smelling of smoke, her sheets and everything else.'

Stuart: 'She would do [UNK]'

Ann: 'Mind you they have done a bit more to it since Wiggie's been there in as much as she's had a big curtain put across'

Stuart: 'Oh yeah.
Across the top of the stairs like or [UNK]'

Ann: 'All the way across.
Because Steve couldn't sleep.'

Stuart: 'Because of the light in that little'

Ann: 'Because it's light.
See you'd even the patio door light went'

Stuart: 'Straight upstairs.'

Ann: 'straight upstairs.'

Stuart: 'And that'

Ann: 'Because he's, and then'

Stuart: 'skylight [UNK].
Mm yeah.'

Ann: 'skylight.
He's had a blind put up a special blind that leads straight across the fanlight.
And she's had curtains big track put across so that sh'

Stuart: 'She can shut it off.'

Ann: 'she can shut it right off.
She couldn't, she just wasn't sleeping.
Said was broad daylight.'

Stuart: 'Mhm.'

Ann: 'She said oh he you know we've had all that done.
Tracked across the ceiling so that shut the [UNK] off.
She said he just couldn't sleep in there.'

Stuart: 'With the light.'

Ann: 'With all the lights and daylight and sunshine through the bloody thing and It was alright once he got off but he had a job getting off when it was'

Stuart: 'Mm mm.'

Ann: 'as I say when it was sunlight shining through the bloody thing on his face.
Mm they've had a special, they had a skylight blind made.'

Stuart: 'Mm mm.'

Ann: 'They couldn't have an ordinary one cos it would hang down.
Has to be on a runners on the side as well otherwise it would just fall down.'

Stuart: 'Side yeah so it [UNK] fall [UNK]'

Ann: 'Yeah.'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'It's got a, you know like a frame what you put in along.'

Stuart: 'Like a venetian blind in a way [UNK].'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'Or a straight down blind but at an angle but er but on runners to hold, yeah.'

Ann: 'But it's got runners to hold the side in you see?'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'I mean [UNK] but Steven would but'

Stuart: 'Do they owe [UNK]'

Ann: '[UNK] the building society and erm'

Stuart: '[UNK] the building society.
Yeah.'

Ann: 'They'll have to pay another mortgage as well.'

Stuart: 'Yeah but on the yeah but I mean if she sold it for thirty two she'd still owe them nine thousand wouldn't she?'

Ann: 'Well she must have paid a bit off.
She's been in there about three years.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.
Well say she owes them nine thousand anyway.'

Ann: 'Yeah.'

Stuart: 'But then er if they wanted another mortgage it would be'

Ann: 'That would be added to it you see.'

Stuart: 'They'd probably have a fifty thousand pound mortgage to pay off the the existing mortgage on that one and the balance.
I mean they can afford it between them.'

Ann: 'Well I don't know, I mean Steve must pay about eighty pounds a bloody week.'

Stuart: 'Oh yeah of course Steven and his maintenance.
Maintenance.'

Ann: 'Maintenance and one thing and another.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.
Yeah that would cut it down wouldn't it? [UNK] on their own you can say they'd be able to afford it but if you consider the outgoings as well eighty pound a'

Ann: 'Mind you saying that, three hundred fifty pound a month to buy a bigger mortgage anyway.
Nowadays.'

Stuart: 'For the interest rate yeah, but it would only buy the same sort of mortgage that Tina's got on it already.'

Ann: 'Yeah well that's what I mean.
They could have bought, afford a'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'a a better property for about forty four thousand or whatever for the same money.
Cos that's how it's worked out.'

Stuart: 'No cos she still owes, if she sold it she'd still owe the balance between the selling price and'

Ann: 'Yeah so she's got to buy a cheaper one and that would be added to it.'

Stuart: 'That would be added to it you see.'

Ann: 'Mm and just his wages how much extra they could afford.'

Stuart: 'That's it.'

Ann: 'I know Steven would like [UNK].'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'He'd like one with a spare bedroom so the children can come and stop.
I mean Tina's worried now, she's got his mother coming for christmas for a fortnight.
Don't know where the hell she'll sleep, she's got to sleep in the living room.'

Stuart: 'Mm.
[UNK] But that's about fifty [UNK] isn't it?'

Ann: 'Fifty two [UNK] probably get the fifty.'

Stuart: 'As I say you're looking at a'

Ann: 'Hefty mortgage.
Tina reckons out of her wages she's got ninety [UNK], ninety six pound a week out of her wages just for mortgage and'

Stuart: 'Expenses.'

Ann: 'expenses.
That's gone before she starts.'

Stuart: 'And then out of Wiggie's he's got'

Ann: 'Seventy five I think he pays.
It's a lot of money gone before you've even [UNK]'

Stuart: 'Mhm before you even start.
[UNK] Mm.'

Ann: 'Depends what you want most don't it I suppose?'

Stuart: 'Mm mm.
That's true.'

Ann: 'She'd like to change the car.
I mean she never liked that car.
Ever.
She had a nice car before Chris made her have that more or less.
She didn't want it.
She hated it at first, she wouldn't drive it.
Noisy and clumsy, she didn't like it at all.
She never has really.'

Stuart: 'It's not it's not a bad car is it?'

Ann: 'She doesn't like it.
Never been happy with it.
Never.
It was Chris's idea to have the diesel one and that model.
He talked her into it.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'But she hated it at first.
She'd do anything rather than drive it at first.
I don't know what she had before but it was a'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'Mind you it was quite old.
I think it was a car that she'd had for was well looked after her dad used to see to it for her but it was she'd had it for some years and she was always poodling about in you see.
And it was her second car that she'd ever had sort of thing.'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'She'd had it five or six years or something like that.
You know, think it was about ten year old when she got rid of it.
Something like that.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'But, say it was a lovely little car really.
And she hated that.'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'Times she used to go [UNK] really hate it.'

Stuart: 'Yeah if that one, that Elizabeth Terrace one is, is the one I think it is which is the one fairly near the end in that in that bottom, bottom row I think the [UNK] live in the first one, they still live in the first one on the corner.
I'm not sure if they've moved actually now.
They may have done.
Got a funny feeling they have now.
But [UNK] Who's that?'

Ann: 'Paper man.'

Stuart: 'Bloody hell.'

Ann: 'Morning.'

Stuart: 'Did somebody kick you out of bed this morning Brian?'

Ann: 'Thank you very much.
Thankyou.
Bubye.'

Stuart: 'Thought somebody must have kicked him out of bed this morning.
Only half half past ten.'

Ann: '[UNK] quarter past ten.'

Stuart: 'That ain't bad.
Got the time to have a quick look at the paper now haven't we?'

Ann: 'Yeah.'

Stuart: '[UNK] The Standard?'

Ann: 'I don't mind.'

Stuart: 'Oh [UNK] mind at all'

## 018207

Ann: 'And if we make an appointment to view some places and then we'll know what time we've got to doing the shopping and fit it in round taking mum.
Seeing mum.'

Stuart: '[UNK] something erm next week.'

Ann: 'So you don't fancy this afternoon?'

Stuart: 'In the morning.
Oh yeah well yeah I mean if if they if'

Ann: 'Cos as I say if we did see Sefton Avenue or New Drove today.'

Stuart: 'If there's nothing available.
That's what I meant.'

Ann: 'Oh yeah, there's plenty of time.
I don't really want to go on a Saturday.
[UNK] Saturday afternoons with mum.'

Stuart: '[UNK] Saturday afternoons with Helen.'

Ann: '[UNK] well I wouldn't be absolutely if, if I had to go out then I'd have to go out.
Then there's always Saturday morning [UNK] see Helen but then Stuart likes to sleep in.
But no I think Saturday's out really.
It's not a day for viewing houses.
We could go out Sunday?
And mum could come as well.'

Stuart: 'I don't know whether they work [UNK]'

Ann: '[UNK] Oh yes.
People at work all the week don't they?'

Stuart: 'Yes.'

Ann: 'Gets dark in the evenings then then then definitely.
That's the only time you can view a property.
I mean unless somebody's living in it you can't go in the evenings in the winter can you?
And I don't fancy a house that somebody's actually living in.
Cos then you've got ta wait while they'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'And it can all fall through because theirs is falling through or they can't get out when you want and that can go on for Can it not?'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'Sometimes it just can't be helped cos there's nothing in your price range you know that you like that isn't empty but I would prefer an empty property so that when we decide and then whatever just [UNK]'

Ann: 'Certainly if we'd see something that would do this afternoon, or [UNK] New Drove [UNK] today, that's fine.'

Stuart: 'No problem.'

Ann: 'Two of them at New Drove are downstairs and one is an upstairs.
The one upstairs, because it hasn't got a bay window'

Stuart: 'Yes.'

Ann: 'is larger.
The upstairs one is slightly larger.'

Stuart: 'The upstairs one's larger? [UNK]'

Ann: '[UNK] number seven which is an upstairs one hasn't got any bay windows.
It is larger than the two five and six that are downstairs.'

Stuart: 'Who's selling that one?'

Ann: 'Well one's Cornerstone.
One's Cornerstone'

Stuart: 'So one's Cornerstone and two are the other [UNK]'

Ann: 'Two are Hansard'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'I think it's Cornerstone one that's the larger of the two, the three.
Six seven.
Hansard.'

Stuart: 'Hansard.'

Ann: 'They're doing five and seven so they've got one above each other.'

Stuart: 'So they've got one one's doing two and one's doing one.'

Ann: 'One's doing five and seven which is this is for two and one's doing six which is this one.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'Seven is definitely slightly bigger than six and five.
I checked it out.
The lounge is fourteen by ten.
The bedroom is thirteen nine by nine [UNK] instead of eleven by eight.
That kitchen's thirteen by five, that totals eleven by seven.'

Stuart: 'Neither here nor there is it?'

Ann: 'No.
None of it's much difference.
It's only a diff er it's a matter of two feet here and'

Stuart: 'Yes.'

Ann: 'But then I don't mind [UNK].
I don't mind living upstairs or on the ground.
Well I mean if they've got the key to both might haven't decided on both of them you might as well go and see them.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'Both of them.
See which one you like the best or if you like them at all.
But as it's got that financial package'

Stuart: 'That's Cornerstone?'

Ann: 'Yeah.'

Stuart: 'Don't know whether the same applies to the other two.'

Ann: '[UNK] it.
The financial package [UNK].'

Stuart: 'With Cornerstone?'

Ann: '[UNK] Cornerstone.'

Stuart: 'Doesn't actually say that in Pantiles'

Ann: 'No'

Stuart: 'Oh.
Just have to ask [UNK].'

Ann: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'But actually the one at Cornerstone is fifty pound cheaper than the both of them at Hansard.'

Ann: 'It is!'

Stuart: 'Fifty pound.'

Ann: 'One's nine nine fifty and one's nine nine'

Stuart: '[UNK] five, yeah.'

Ann: 'So it's forty five pound different. [UNK]'

Stuart: 'Well that's a good way, if you think about it he's got, he's got four flats there hasn't he?'

Ann: 'Oh yeah.'

Stuart: 'Four flats at thirty thousand.
That's a hundred and twenty thousand for two houses.
They could be sixty thousand apiece.'

Ann: 'Yeah.'

Stuart: 'Whereas if he had, if he sold them as separate houses he'd probably get forty thousand apiece.'

Ann: 'Yeah that's just [UNK] Yeah.'

Stuart: 'Forty five thousand even apiece.'

Ann: 'Yeah.'

Stuart: 'But he's making the money by selling them as flats.'

Ann: 'Yeah.
The only difference is he's had a few thousand extra because it's got two kitchens and two bathrooms.
[UNK] partitions and'

Stuart: 'Yeah true he's had that yeah extra fittings.'

Ann: 'But apart from that oh an extra bath instead of the other bedroom'

Stuart: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

Ann: 'and erm another kitchen instead of a dining room or something and that's the only difference.
Say three four thousand probably.
For the extra bits and pieces that's all.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'I don't know how many of them there are.
Whether they only had four flats or whether there's a flat on another block and another block of fours down the road.
I mean I don't know.'

Stuart: 'Only assume there's you've got that one block.'

Ann: 'Well there might be four blocks of four or I du n no.'

Stuart: 'No I don't think so.
Not enough space for them.'

Ann: 'No I don't know.
I mean you know the area better than me.'

Stuart: 'Unless they've knocked them garages down or something [UNK]'

Ann: 'I've no idea [UNK].
I know them council houses aren't usually [UNK] but I mean I can't visualize how much land there is.
I only know that by going to school and [UNK]'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: '[UNK] where they are. [UNK]'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'Probably should have gone the other way into town but'

Stuart: '[UNK] that'

Ann: 'Eh?'

Stuart: 'Neither here nor there. [UNK]'

Ann: 'Well you could have gone sort of like round the Rainbow and that way on.
That's what I meant.'

Ann: '[UNK] the bypass [UNK] that end of town would have been perhaps a little bit clearer.'

Stuart: '[UNK] If you look at the first it might help you to decide whether you like'

Ann: 'That's it.
Whether you wanna go and see it.'

Stuart: 'Whether you wanna go and see them or not.
Whether you like the positions.'

Ann: 'I mean we know where Sefton Avenue is and we know that's'

Stuart: 'Well we know where it is.'

Ann: 'a nice house.'

Stuart: 'Well we don't know really.
We haven't seen it have we?'

Ann: 'Well I mean [UNK] I mean'

Stuart: 'Yeah but we haven't actually looked ins'

Ann: 'No but I mean I know which house it is with that [UNK] one, and you do don't you?'

Stuart: 'I think so yes.'

Ann: 'Well I think so as well.'

Stuart: 'But it would be nice just to go and have a quick check.'

Ann: 'Oh I think, just to make sure that [UNK]'

Stuart: 'Just to make sure I like it.
Or'

Ann: 'it is the house that we're thinking about.
We think it is.'

Stuart: 'You may not like it.'

Ann: 'I said as soon as I see it in the paper oh that looks nice.
Where's that?
I mean not sure.'

Stuart: '[UNK] is it?
Or is this the one round the other end?'

Ann: 'It's that one.'

Stuart: 'It's up here.
That one there right on the corner yeah?'

Ann: 'Yes.'

Ann: 'That's it.'

Stuart: 'I thought there was a separate [UNK] but it's not, no it's not is it?'

Ann: 'Think it is.'

Stuart: 'It's an older property.
Got the double glazing.
Alright.'

Ann: '[UNK] Looks nice.
Nice house though isn't it?'

Stuart: 'Yeah it's an older, more solid house.'

Ann: 'You know sometimes I like as I say they've got'

Stuart: 'Yeah.
Yeah Yeah true.
Very true.'

Ann: 'they've got erm'

Stuart: 'Very true.'

Ann: 'Yeah it's a nice house.'

Ann: 'And this is a back, the back door [UNK]'

Stuart: 'Oh I see.
Yeah.'

Ann: 'this one because you, there's the back view look I mean that's that's a back door isn't it?
So you have the downstairs back and the the front stairs go up to the can't actually see [UNK] That's definitely the back door.'

Stuart: 'There's a parking space as well.'

Ann: 'Oh yeah it says allotted parking space.'

## 018301

Ann: 'We have made him an offer but he's not very keen.'

Stuart: 'I don't think, I don't think he will.
He's not like that.'

Ann: 'It looks as if he's not very keen on the price we want to pay.
He said he knows the market's low and he'd rather wait.
But then we wouldn't be able to afford it if the market goes up and'

None: 'That's right.
[UNK] same time [UNK].'

Stuart: 'If it's on, if it's on the market for a long while.
He can have it on the market for a year or so.'

None: 'Yeah.'

Stuart: 'And he's and he's'

None: 'He's got you there and [UNK]'

Stuart: 'Well at the moment he's got us'

Ann: 'Well that's it.
I mean we're paying two hundred and fifty pound a month so at least he's getting that coming in.
But then you can really have a mortgage for that.'

None: '[UNK] and the thing is as well [UNK]'

Ann: 'No.
But at the moment he's well he's not come back to us with any answer from our offer at all so we're we're presuming that means no so we thought we'd better start looking.'

None: 'Oh and if you're paying that kind of money you could afford a mortgage couldn't you?'

Ann: 'That's it.'

Stuart: 'Thereabouts anyway.'

Ann: 'Yeah it's it's not much more.
And Stuart's been and enquired and it wouldn't be much more for a small property.'

None: 'When the market lifts then you'd [UNK].'

Ann: 'That's it.'

## 018302

Ann: 'There's not a lot more in here is there?
There's a bedroom, it's very [UNK]'

Jill: 'They don't make them any more do they?'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Jill: 'In burgundy.
I don't know what other colours they had [UNK].
But it's reasonably good quality.
There's an airing cupboard [UNK] Probably got a dead body in there.'

Jill: 'I watch too many mysteries don't I?'

Ann: '[UNK] Cooker goes in there and the washing machine in there.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'Nowhere for a fridge.
Well you'd have to have it sticking out [UNK] round.'

Stuart: 'This is a bit silly isn't it?
Not having any room for a fridge anywhere.'

Ann: 'The cooker would have go in there and the washing machine in there.'

Stuart: 'Washing machine in there.'

Ann: 'No fridge.'

Jill: 'No he hasn't thought about it very well has he?'

Ann: 'I'm afraid it would have to be sticking out. [UNK]'

Jill: 'Is it, is it a tall fridge?
Or is it just an ordinary worktop one?'

Ann: 'No just an ordinary fridge.'

Stuart: 'There isn't a fridge.'

Ann: 'Well there will be.
Just an ordinary one.'

Jill: '[UNK] what the other ones are like.'

Stuart: 'Unless you, unless you get the fridge in the [UNK] cupboard.'

Ann: 'Oh this is just exactly the same only the other way round.'

Stuart: 'Same, the same but opposite.'

Ann: 'Yeah.
[UNK] in the cupboard [UNK]'

Stuart: 'Oh yeah.'

Jill: 'Oh that's [UNK]'

Ann: '[UNK] It hasn't got a sink in this one.'

Stuart: 'It hasn't got a toilet either.'

Ann: 'Or toilet.

Ann: 'Er actually [UNK] it has been broken into, this one.'

Jill: 'Oh no.'

Ann: 'We looked at it outside and and the window'

Stuart: 'It looks like it yeah. [UNK]'

Ann: 'at the back there is broken.'

Ann: '[UNK] somebody's been helping themselves.'

Jill: '[UNK] fire alarms keep [UNK] though don't they?'

Ann: 'Number seven.
This is the [UNK].'

Jill: '[UNK]?'

Ann: 'Yeah.
Yeah you see [UNK] your washing machine.
Cooker that'

Stuart: 'Oh I see.
This is different isn't it?'

Jill: 'Yeah.
Got a bit more space.'

Ann: 'Yeah.
See you could have your cooker one side and your washing machine and fridge, washing machine under there and fridge there.'

Jill: 'So what you've achieved is this piece over the stairs.'

Ann: 'Yeah.
Mm.
I said the one upstairs was bigger.'

Stuart: 'Yes.
You said it was bigger didn't you?
Yeah.'

Ann: 'I was reading the things and I said it was a bigger upstairs is, are bigger than the downstairs.'

Jill: 'It's better cos the other one's a little bit of an alley isn't it, the kitchen?'

Ann: 'Yeah.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'It's quite pleasant that is.'

Ann: 'Yeah you see it's bigger cos the bedroom'

Ann: 'is a bigger bed bigger room altogether.'

Jill: 'Goodness.
What a difference.'

Stuart: 'Oh there is a difference.
No this is the living room.'

Jill: 'Yeah.'

Stuart: 'This is the living room here.'

Ann: 'Yeah that's right.
This is the bedroom.'

Jill: 'But even so'

Ann: 'But even the bedroom's bigger.'

Stuart: 'Oh crikey that's a big bedroom too isn't it?'

Ann: 'It's bigger.
Most definitely.'

Stuart: 'Yeah I said [UNK]'

Ann: 'So you'd have [UNK]'

Jill: 'It's a lot better.
Yeah.
Yeah.'

Ann: 'I could tell by the you know the details'

Stuart: 'Financial [UNK]'

Ann: 'it just seemed that'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Jill: 'The way they were reading.'

Ann: 'Yeah the way it was reading.
I said to Stuart I'm sure'

Jill: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'the upstairs is bigger [UNK].
He said that can't be.
But you've got the hall and that underneath you see.'

Jill: 'Yeah it's the landing and everything.'

Stuart: 'Underneath us yeah.'

Ann: 'Yeah.'

Jill: 'It would be quite pleasant up here.'

Ann: 'Yeah.
I like this one, I don't like the downstairs one so much.'

Stuart: 'No I like this much more.'

Jill: 'What colour's the bathroom?'

Stuart: '[UNK] the bathroom's even nice.'

Sue: 'Yeah but he told me he told me he told'

Sue: 'that he's not even to phone the place.'

Jeanie: 'That's right.

Sue: 'Yeah but why don't [UNK] tell the girls?'

Jeanie: 'Well exactly.'

Sue: 'Because you know what, they're up in the air aren't they?'

Jeanie: 'Yeah [UNK], can you believe it?'

Sue: 'Oh well if he wants to know why I'm there and [UNK] me are you off sick I shall just show him a I've got proof that I've been off sick.'

Sue: 'Ah but he isn't there yet is he?'

Jeanie: 'What, today? [UNK]'

Sue: 'Will [UNK] go?'

Jeanie: 'You don't think he'

Sue: 'Well it it's gotta be seen to believe.
You can't say'

Jeanie: 'Well yeah that's true.'

Sue: 'until he turns up.'

Stuart: 'No.'

Sue: 'Can you?'

Jeanie: 'True.
But the thing is he he's gonna be ever so, isn't he?
He'll be making excuses all the way round [UNK]'

Sue: 'No I've gotta go.'

Jeanie: 'Eh?'

Sue: 'He he won't be there long if he does come.'

Jeanie: 'Well that's it.
That's it.
But I mean if he doesn't and sh, I mean why shouldn't you?

Stuart: 'Okay.'

Jeanie: 'Okay.'

Ann: 'Cheerio.'

Stuart: 'Toodaloo.'

Jeanie: 'Yeah.

We're not going home.'

Jeanie: 'Oh aye yeah Ann.

Ann: 'Yeah, well there's no point in going home.'

Jeanie: 'No that's true.
That's true.
[UNK] okay.'

Ann: 'Bye.'

Jeanie: 'See you.
Bye.'

Stuart: 'See you tomorrow.'

Stuart: 'There we go.
Is that better dear?'

Ann: 'Yeah.
That's lovely.'

Stuart: 'Shall we have a nice cup of tea?'

Ann: 'I was gasping.
Especially when that man was'

Stuart: 'Rabbitting?'

Ann: 'Yeah, which I didn't understand any of it.'

Stuart: 'No.'

Ann: 'Pension mortgages and this mortgage and and he didn't really know how er er cos that that foreign Lucy or whatever her name was'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'that foreign lady was quite amused.
She was laughing when you were asking him questions.'

Stuart: 'Oh.'

Ann: 'as if to say ah ah he's not sure what he's doing.
He's got somebody here who knows.'

Ann: 'Instead of just sitting there and quoting all these figures'

Stuart: '[UNK] yeah'

Ann: 'and blinding you with science.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'Somebody who can ask questions and knew what he was talking about.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'And she was giggling away.
She kept raising her eyebrows and laughing.
I was watching her.'

Stuart: 'Well I couldn't see her cos I had my back turned.'

Ann: 'No you had your back to her.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'But I could see behind you and she was'

Stuart: 'Well there you are.
When you do know a bit about it you yes you want to know'

Ann: 'Well that's it.
You're not, and you're not gonna be blinded by all these like he was, what was he saying about all endowments are are not unit then you were saying yes they are and'

Stuart: 'I didn't know what [UNK] on about there.
I I think he got his'

Ann: '[UNK] said that.'

Stuart: 'Oh he knew what he was talking about but'

Ann: 'But you were confusing him because you knew, where he's used to just sitting there and telling blah blah blah blah and'

Stuart: 'Well you see the thing is they they they'

Ann: 'And you knew what he was on about.'

Stuart: 'they quote this unit linked business.
Now it's all'

Ann: 'And you didn't want that did you?'

Stuart: 'well and good a unit linked policy but as I said to you before that if they, if the market crashes the day before your policy is due out you'

Ann: 'And you haven't got enough money.'

Stuart: 'you could, you can lose a th I don't want one.'

Stuart: 'If the market crashes the day before you take your policy's due to mature wallop.
You can lose a lot of money in a you know, just like that.'

Ann: 'But do you think this thing what he was on about, pension mortgage, do you think that would be better?
Was that that PEP thing what's all in the papers at the moment?'

Stuart: 'No.'

Ann: 'Is that what it means?'

Stuart: 'PEP's different.'

Ann: 'Oh.
Is it similar?'

Stuart: 'PEP's a personal equity plan.'

Ann: 'Oh.
Sorry.'

Stuart: 'Which is different.
To be perfectly honest in my current situation'

Ann: 'Mhm.'

Stuart: 'a pension mortgage would be more advantageous.'

Ann: 'Well that's the most important thing isn't it?'

Stuart: 'At the moment.
Because well I'm not in a pension scheme at work.
But I have got an option to go in it'

Ann: 'Yeah.'

Stuart: 'if I want to.'

Ann: 'Mhm.'

Stuart: 'Erm the only problem is well, even s even, not so much now because because the er [UNK] a bit better.
Because of the m because of the way pensions and that are are organized now, they're more flexible now I mean, you can go to a job beforehand if if if your company had a pension scheme, you were obliged to go in it that was it.
All your other arrangements went up, went through the window.'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'Erm so it it it it's difficult.'

Ann: 'Mm I know you can take them along with you nowadays can't you and [UNK] into a'

Stuart: 'You can now take, now now now you can take them with you.'

Ann: 'Mm.
Where they used to be frozen and then you started another one wherever you went next time.'

Stuart: 'That's right.
That's right.
Whereas now [UNK]'

Ann: 'And you ended up with three four d silly little bits and pieces didn't you?'

Stuart: 'Yeah.
Yeah.
Whereas now you see all the they can put them all into one.'

Ann: 'Yeah.
I know you can take them with you now.'

Stuart: 'Mm.
So in a way I think'

Ann: 'And it was a lot less money as well wasn't it?'

Stuart: 'I mm yeah but that w don't forget'

Ann: 'It started'

Stuart: 'that was sixty five.'

Ann: 'Yeah [UNK].'

Stuart: 'The quotation he give was sixty five and as he said which is true they double every five years.
Particularly in the later years there's you know'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'more And that's why I said, when it sounded so low that's why I I still doubt his figures.
I still think two hundred pound a month a thirty thousand pound mortgage it's too low.'

Ann: 'And and a cash sum at the end of it.'

Stuart: 'Still think it's low.'

Ann: 'Seems quite doesn't seem a lot does it?'

Stuart: 'No.
I'm pretty certain'

Ann: 'And would you still have to have an insurance on top of that?'

Stuart: 'You have to have term assurance.'

Ann: 'So you'd still have to have'

Stuart: 'You'd have'

Ann: 'you'd have the two hundred pound and then you'd have a life insurance on top?'

Stuart: 'No no no.
No.
That was it, two hundred and twelve pound'

Ann: 'The whole lot?'

Stuart: 'The whole lot.'

Ann: 'Well why doesn't everybody have them then?'

Stuart: 'Because not everybody's eligible for them.'

Ann: 'I know but they didn't, he didn't suggest it to you or why doesn't he say well there is this er er, you said that he didn't.
And he must have known that they're gonna be cheaper so why doesn't he advise people who are starting out to take one of them?'

Stuart: 'Didn't ask [UNK]'

Ann: 'Rather than a'

Stuart: 'Didn't ask the questions.'

Ann: 'I know, exactly.
But surely that's'

Stuart: 'He didn't he'

Ann: 'his job.
If he's trying to find you the cheapest'

Stuart: 'He's not doing his job.
Basically'

Ann: 'Exactly.'

Stuart: 'he's not doing his job.'

Ann: 'Because a young couple going in well even in our situation, you haven't got much money and you want the cheapest thing for the best we you know.
But he never suggested it.
You said what about a company, what about a a pension mortgage and he'

Stuart: 'He didn't, he he didn't ask the question.
Which he should have asked.'

Ann: 'Mm.
Exactly.
Yeah because it is cheaper and'

Stuart: 'You see the thing is you see I mean wh wh when this law came out, LAUTRO and all that business came out that, and best advice and all this sort of thing you had to go through all the finances and what people earned and all that sort of thing.
What they've got insurance already erm so on and so forth.
And arrange around those circumstances the best advice package.'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'But he didn't ask me the questions.
He just he just he just'

Ann: 'No he just could do an endowment one and that was it.'

Stuart: 'he just assumed it was gonna be'

Ann: 'An an endowment policy, and endowment mortgage and that was it.
He didn't tell you anything else.'

Stuart: 'No.
Well you see when he said your base is gonna be'

Ann: 'I know.'

Stuart: 'a hundred and two hundred'

Ann: 'Ninety six.'

Stuart: 'and fifteen pounds or whatever'

Ann: 'Two hundred and five and then that on a ninety six'

Stuart: 'And then a percent I could get you a percent off as a first time buyer.'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'That brings it down to a hundred and ninety six for the first year.
Then it goes back up to the base rate.'

Ann: 'Yeah.'

Stuart: 'Not, I know all that's that's obvious.'

Ann: 'That's quite clear.
Mm.'

Stuart: 'But then when he said two hundred and one pounds for a pension mortgage I thought well if a hundred and ninety'

Ann: 'That's only five pound a month to earn your pension.'

Stuart: 'if a hu if a hundred and ninety six is only your base how come you don't'

Ann: 'That gives you five pound a month towards your pension which is nothing is it?'

Stuart: 'how do you get two how do you get two hundred and one pounds or two hundred and fifteen pounds and what with, because of the term assurance on top.
That's fourteen pounds a month term assurance.
Quite high I think.'

Ann: 'What's term assurance?
Don't understand that.'

Stuart: 'Term assurance is life insurance just on life only.
With no cash sum at the end.'

Ann: 'Well if you died you'd be dead.
Well that's fair enough isn't it?
You wouldn't want anything else.'

Stuart: 'But er throughout throughout the term of my life'

Ann: 'And if you died the [UNK] would be paid.'

Stuart: 'If I died a lump sum of thirty thousand pounds is payable.'

Ann: 'That's it, you'd pay [UNK]'

Stuart: 'But I think fourteen pounds a month is quite high.
Term assurance.
I'm tempted, I'm I'm I'm tempted to have a word with Mick. [UNK]'

Ann: 'What and arrange your own?'

Stuart: 'Well'

Ann: 'Or he'd just tell you?'

Stuart: 'well I, whether I, I don't know whether he would or whether he wouldn't.
I mean he might he might not but then again he might.
He might if I, if I talk to him he might tell me what sort of I don't want to hassle him you see cos I've hassled'

Ann: 'No, that's it.'

Stuart: 'him before [UNK].
Not on that sort of thing but other things as well sort of thing and I don't wanna I'd like to know.'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'I'd like to know before you know'

Ann: 'You've got to get the right deal.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.
I, I did two hundred and one pound a month or two hundred and fift okay it sounds cheap but I don't know fourteen pound a month just for li thirty thousand pound life cover over suppose it's the'

Ann: 'Yeah but that's not that much a we'

Stuart: 'I suppose it's the term of years.'

Ann: 'It's only three quid a m a week.'

Stuart: 'Yeah but I suppose it's the term of years as well.
You sort of to sixty five rather than at sixty.'

Ann: 'Well that's it.'

Stuart: 'So that probably makes it but I say without having me own book to check it I can't'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'I can't tell you.
You see you can, you get a lot, you can get tax relief off that or you used to be able to get tax relief.'

Ann: 'Well he said you could get tax relief on the whole lot.'

Stuart: 'On the whole lot, yeah.'

Ann: 'That's what he said.
At twenty five percent.'

Stuart: 'At twenty five percent.
I think you still, I'm not sure whether they've changed the law round or not cos they'

Ann: 'Well that's what he said didn't he?'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'Er you'd be handy for a a tax relief on the whole lot rather than just'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'part of it.'

Stuart: 'Cos that [UNK] you see if you, if you, if you could link up life assurance to your pension you could get tax relief on your life assurance you see?'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'Which makes it advantageous because there's no tax relief on life policies now as there was'

Stuart: 'There used to be, yeah.'

Ann: 'There used to be but there is no'

Ann: 'But they stopped it.'

Stuart: 'there is, they stopped it.
There isn't any more.'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'No, I'm sort of I think he confused himself as well as confusing me slightly [UNK]'

Ann: 'Yeah be because you you confused him.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'Because you knew.'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'Rather than somebody as I say like me who sat down there and he'd just quote all these figures and you wouldn't know what the hell he was on about and just, all you, all I would understand at the end is that's what you gotta pay.'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'Which is what most people that go in there'

Stuart: 'Are interested in.'

Ann: 'Well they wouldn't understand all the rest.
This plan, that plan, the other plan.
They only know well you either have this option paying this amount, that option paying that amount or that option paying that amount and which one do you want to have.'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'And and you don't understand any of the rest of it.'

Stuart: 'No.
No.'

Ann: 'You just sit there mm yeah mm no mm well that's the cheapest, that's the dearest and and take their advice which ones the best for you and have it.
And that's er that's all normal people who don't understand any of it that's the way they'd go about it isn't it?'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'You'd just accept whatever was'

Stuart: 'See the other thing, I don't know well no I'm not sure you can now.
See if I took a pension mortgage out it would be linked to me lumped into me current pension contract.
Cos I've already got a pension scheme running.
Cos I've contracted out of SERPS.
And also got erm erm what used to be called [UNK] seventy seven.'

Ann: 'Yes Stuart.'

Stuart: 'Erm a frozen pension with the Pru'

Ann: 'Yeah.'

Stuart: 'linked in with it at the moment.
That's that's that's my pension arrangements at the moment.'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'Mm so I'm tempted er if I'm gonna do a pension [UNK]'

Ann: 'I tell you what you wa who you wanna go and see.
Who I saw when I bought the house at er thing.
Now he was, I know he blinded me with science but he wa, he was really very good and he had his computer there and he went through all these different societies and plans.'

Stuart: 'Well that's what he's done.
You see that's what he's done.'

Ann: 'No but he had I mean he had a screen and er'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'and that was that's along near Maxie's near the post office but it's a'

Ann: 'Yeah, I saw him.'

Stuart: 'Oh the erm the Scots chap?
Er what's his name?'

Ann: 'Oh and he was smashing.
And he explained it all to me.'

Stuart: 'Oh I can't think of his name now.
I I I have had dealings with him.'

Ann: 'He he explained it all.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'And although there was all these figures and er and he explained what was best, I mean he was purely a financial I mean he he as he said when we went in cos it doesn't make no difference, I I I'm not attached to anything.
I'm here to'

Stuart: 'No.
But nor's he.'

Ann: 'I am here to give you advice.'

Stuart: 'That's it.'

Ann: 'And that's it.'

Stuart: 'Independent financial advice.'

Ann: 'And and therefore I'm not here to sell you this or that.
I'm here purely to find out, you want to buy this council house and and and I'm here purely to find out your circumstances and and what would be the best deal for you.'

Stuart: 'That's right.'

Ann: 'And he went, I mean I was there for blooming ages.
And he went through everything till he found out and it wa I didn't have the abs the absolute cheapest one.
Cos he didn't think that was a because Steven was disabled and that as well and on my money and one thing and another'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'and and one thing and another but er it I mean mi mine ended up with the Bradford and Bingley, I mean'

Stuart: 'Yeah well they're agents for Bradley, Bradford and Bingley [UNK]'

Ann: 'Yeah I know but he did say that even though agents I'm not giving you this and then he showed me all the things you know to sort of prove that he was doing it.
But that's wh oh yeah that's who I had.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.
It doesn't matter what building society you go to.'

Ann: 'No well that's what he said, it doesn't but I mean he went through all these and insurance companies and because of my kidney being removed I had to pay, I had to pay higher even though I didn't have to have a bloody medical but I had to pay high because of my'

Stuart: 'Yeah.
Medical condition.'

Ann: 'because I'd had medical Yeah it was cos I'd had all these operations.
You know you had to put how many operations have you had in the last ten years and have are you er receiving any treatment and all that bloody blah blah blah.'

Ann: 'And so mine, mine was higher'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'than er than other peoples which is why he went to all these bloody quotes.'

Stuart: 'See the thing yeah.
As I say the thing, the thing is as I say it's you you your mor'

Ann: 'He sorted it all out.
But he was really good.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.
Your mortgage, it doesn't matter who your mortgage is with, basically.
I mean you can go to most places and'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'you're gonna be paying'

Ann: 'But when you buy a council house it is slightly different in as much as some some of them won't have them.'

Stuart: 'Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.'

Ann: 'Then also, he also gave me I mean I got hundred percent mortgage which you are allowed on, I mean the law says er t the chance to buy so therefore you don't have to have a deposit.
But he also gave me enough to cover all my fees, legal fees.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

Ann: 'So I borrowed over what the house was worth.
But that was only because I'd lived in it for a long time and I got a discount so the house was really'

Stuart: 'Discount.
Yeah.'

Ann: 'worth more'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'than what I was paying for it.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'Cos I got a discount so er I borrowed another thousand pound'

Stuart: 'To cover your costs.'

Ann: 'to cover all the costs for the survey for Maxie's and and this that and the other.
Which I think come to about eight nine hundred pound.'

Stuart: 'Mm.
As I say it doesn't matter what building'

Ann: 'Anyway he borrowed all that for me.'

Stuart: 'it doesn't matter what building society you go to, you're gonna be paying basically the same rate.
Because they're all the same rate.
The base rate's the same.
You, okay one place you can get a percent discount you might get a percent and a half discount depending on your'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'depending on the building society at the time.
It's the life policy'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'that makes the difference.'

Ann: 'But to go to somebody like him who knew his job'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'which was his job and and had everything there and he, he patched through to this computer this place and different computers that he had.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

Ann: 'And the facility to to get through to.'

Stuart: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Ann: 'That he could get all these to find out what he thought was the best policy in in your'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'as I say because of my health and one thing and another you couldn't just and he, and he was really good he was and explained everything to me I say that'

Stuart: 'Can't think of his name now but I know the chap.
He was a tall chap with glasses. [UNK]'

Ann: 'Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ever so nice.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'He really you know made me feel I say I weren't sat there like I was with that fella thinking well he don't seem to know what he's saying anyway.'

Stuart: 'No no.'

Ann: 'Which is what the impression I got about him, he wasn't really sure himself.'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'But I think that was partly you floored him because you knew.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.
Yeah.'

Ann: 'He sort of was a bit you got him a bit couldn't say.
But certainly that man that I went to that time he was very very nice and'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'then you could see he'd patch into all these different bloody things and'

Stuart: 'Mm mm.'

Ann: 'and and and I ended up with er a reasonable'

Stuart: 'Was yours an endowment?
Or just'

Ann: 'It was an endowment.
Yeah it had to be.
[UNK] I dunno why but it had to be. [UNK]'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'Well I don't know but that's what'

Stuart: 'When does your mortgage finish then?'

Ann: 'My mortgage?
I had it in eighty one, twenty years so another ten years.'

Stuart: 'So in fact there's still an endowment policy on you to cover that mortgage?'

Ann: 'No they were all cancelled weren't it?'

Stuart: 'I dunno [UNK]'

Ann: 'Oh yeah I signed the form.'

Stuart: 'So your endowment policy'

Ann: 'Everything's all'

Stuart: 'Ended.'

Ann: 'Yeah.'

Stuart: 'Cancelled.'

Ann: 'Cancelled.
Stopped.'

Stuart: 'Well what about the money?'

Ann: 'The money was all [UNK].
I don't know.
I just signed forms to say that I was no longer responsible or had any claim on the property or whatever.
And that was it.
I didn't have to pay any more and I didn't, and I was passing it over to to Steve.
I don't know what happened.'

Stuart: 'Yeah but what about the [UNK] The life policy was in your name.'

Ann: 'The whole lot was in was it endowment?
No I dunno, it can't have been can it?
I don't know.
No it wasn't it was a no it wasn't an endowment.
I didn't pay.
I only paid extra insurance.'

Stuart: 'Oh just a straight term p policy like I was'

Ann: 'Yeah because yeah because, because of my health.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.'

Ann: 'Yeah.
That was it.
Yeah it was [UNK] Yeah.
Because of my health.'

Stuart: 'It was a term assurance rather than it being an endowment insurance.
Yeah.'

Ann: 'I couldn't, I don't think he could get the other he got that one because of, i in my health you couldn't they couldn't say how long'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'because of my kidney.
The other kidney could go all blah blah blah and this that and the other.
Yeah.
It was just ordinary insurance.
I don't know how much it was.
I don't know.
I mean I only paid a hundred and sixty pound a month but I mean [UNK]'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'Then I only borrowed twenty odd thousand cos I got a forty odd percent discount off the price of the house anyway.'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'Twenty two I think it was, something like that.'

Stuart: 'Mm.
You see [UNK]'

Ann: 'And the rent was thirty six pound a week.
And it ended up I was buying it for less money than what I was paying monthly for rent.'

Stuart: 'Yeah.
Well you would do.'

Ann: 'So it was all'

Stuart: 'It was worth it.'

Ann: 'Might as well have done it.'

Stuart: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Ann: 'So I went into it.'

Stuart: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Ann: 'Yeah it it worked out hundred and sixty one pound a month, with the insurance.
So it's alright I mean I paid the whole bloody lot to them, I didn't'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'sort it all out.
You don't pay it separate, I didn't.
I paid to council offices.'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'And they sorted, they forward it I suppose or did whatever they had to do with it.'

Stuart: 'Mm mm.'

Ann: 'Used to pay at the council offices.
[UNK] different book.
[UNK] used to go and pay it.
Write the cheque out and he'd just take it in.'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'I could have had it done through the bank but he was always up town anyway so'

Stuart: 'Mm.
So it didn't make any difference.'

Ann: 'didn't make any difference one way or the other.'

Stuart: 'Mm.
Mm.'

Stuart: 'So how about you?
You'd have it done through the bank anyway and I'd just pay you weekly I cou might as well rather than monthly.'

Stuart: 'Mm.'

Ann: 'Save you going to the bank.
Couldn't I?
Just give you the money you [UNK] spends.'

Stuart: 'We'll see when we come, when it comes down to it won't we?
What we could do financially.
And sort something out then.'

Ann: 'Well of course we will.
[UNK] expect you to pay'

Stuart: 'But I cert I I I I I ju I it it just sounds you know two hundred pounds a month, just over two hundred pound a month [UNK]'

Ann: 'Sounds smashing dunnit?'

Stuart: 'Sounds wonderful.'

Ann: 'That's what I said, why doesn't everybody have them?'

Stuart: 'Well that's why I can't believe it.'

Ann: 'Well he said go back and tomorrow at least and'

Stuart: 'And check his figures.'

Ann: 'Mhm.
If that's right that's the one you want really isn't it?'

Stuart: 'Well I I I yeah.
I mean obviously I'd have to pay more er for if I want it to end at sixty.'

Ann: 'Mm.
But even then it won't be will it be that much?'

Stuart: 'To get [UNK] to get a higher lump sum.
To get a higher lump sum.
But then you see'

Ann: 'Would it be that much more?'

Stuart: 'Shouldn't think so.'

Ann: 'Well exactly.
So it's gonna'

Stuart: 'You see it's'

Ann: 'be less than a want two hundred and eighty.'

Stuart: 'Oh yeah.'

Ann: '[UNK] I said so you might as well have that and have a lump sum and a blooming house and'

Stuart: 'And a pension.'

Ann: 'And a pension.
That's what I mean.
Might as well have your pension.
[UNK] when you get to sixty.'

Stuart: 'Mm.
Say it's only twenty six years and course with a pension see you can increase your contributions.'

Ann: 'Yeah.
If if you get a better job and what have you you can always'

Stuart: 'Better job or whatever or pay rise or whatever you can increase'

Ann: 'Yeah you'

Stuart: 'your contributions into your pension plan'

Ann: 'Exactly, yes.'

Stuart: 'and still, and finish your mortgage earlier.'

Ann: 'Yeah.'

Stuart: 'Fifty five.'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'Or fifty.
Depending on how much you wanna pay.'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'If you wanna pay more into it.
But I still think [UNK]'

Ann: 'Well see what he comes up with.'

Stuart: 'See what he comes up with, yeah.
See what he comes up with.'

Ann: 'And certainly say two hundred and twenty five pound a month it's still worth having.'

Stuart: 'It's cheaper than we're paying now isn't it?'

Ann: 'Mm.
Even if it's two hundred and fifty it the same'

Stuart: 'Well you'd still'

Ann: 'you're gonna have a pension and and a home.'

Stuart: 'In a way I'd rather pay the same and finish the mortgage earlier.'

Ann: 'Yeah well that's it.
You could volunteer to pay two hundred and fifty a month couldn't you?'

Stuart: 'And pay a higher pension policy.'

Ann: 'Mhm.
That's what I mean.'

Stuart: 'And then and then you've got the option then you've got the further option that if you want to reduce your premiums on your pension you can do.'

Ann: 'If anything happened.
Mm.'

Stuart: 'If anything if if it does You see again and then you see if you're out of a job you see you if you happen to be out of a job then you're not eligible for a pension policy.'

Ann: 'What happens then then?
If you get made redundant?'

Stuart: 'Well.'

Ann: 'And you've already got it.'

Stuart: 'Well, then you have to freeze it.
See that's that's the oth that's another drawback with the pension.
Whereas an endowment policy it doesn't matter.
You you can carry on paying an endowment policy.
So it, you know there's pros and cons either way.'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'There's there's er pros and cons in buying either of tho either of the flats.
You see er that's the thing isn't it?'

Ann: 'Mhm.
But you've got to make the decision cos I like both of them very much.'

Stuart: 'I do.'

Ann: 'So therefore you have to make the decision which one, if it comes down to it, would you like to live in.
I mean if we could get that one down at New Drove what is it, twenty nine?
So that's gonna be, say if you get fifteen hundred off it it's gonna be twenty eight.'

Stuart: 'Call it, it's thirty thousand isn't it?'

Ann: 'Yeah.'

Stuart: 'What is it, twenty nine nine nine five.
You might as well call it thirty thousand [UNK]'

Ann: 'Well say you get twenty eight and a half.
You're gonna get it cheaper the mor the monthly payment is cheaper.
And then aff and then you could afford to buy some blooming carpets.
And with the other one you've got to find a deposit which you'd have to pay back.'

Stuart: 'But you wouldn't have to buy any carpets.'

Ann: 'You wouldn't have to buy the carpets.'

Stuart: 'And you say we'd gonna have to have a cooker and a fridge and that aren't you?'

Ann: 'Well a cooker you definitely, a fridge say we could perhaps borrow that one of mum's until we could afford one.
Or pick up a cheap one.'

Stuart: 'Unless I say if you knocked him down.'

Ann: 'But a cooker's no problem because I know you can go into the Electricity Board and say I'm moving into a new property, I haven't got a cooker and they would, you can get them.
No deposit, just added to your electric bill.
That's a way to because'

Stuart: 'Oh buying it on some sort of'

Ann: 'Oh yeah on er er a financial agreement.'

Stuart: 'Or look around and see what there is going in the, in the market.
And get a sort of'

Ann: 'Second hand one.'

Stuart: 'no percent free credit.'

Ann: 'Yeah.
I mean there's no difficulty in getting a cooker.'

Stuart: 'Say if we I mean if, if we're paying say two hundred pound a month on a mortgage'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'for twenty eight thousand [UNK].
We've got fifty pound a month we can play with and we, to buy'

Ann: 'Well that's it.
You could'

Stuart: 'to buy a cooker over the ne'

Terry: 'Thank god for that.'

Shirley: 'No it was so slow.

Grace: 'Well I hit the ball'

Terry: '[UNK] you're winning.'

Shirley: 'The gate's on now.'

Shirley: 'Yeah, they lost the first one.'

Terry: 'Yeah.

Shirley: 'Well it don't matter now.'

Stuart: 'Yeah that's what, that's what [UNK].'

Ann: 'Yeah.

Stuart: 'Well it's not what I would have done'

Ann: 'But actually'

Stuart: 'but there you go.'

Ann: 'I've got six in the box.'

Stuart: 'That's what I would have done but [UNK]'

Ann: 'But I didn't know you see, I'

Stuart: 'Course not, no.'

Ann: 'I couldn't work it out.'

Stuart: 'I think I would have been tempted to do that.'

Ann: 'I didn't know whether to put two blue queens in or ten things or'

Stuart: 'Mm.
Yeah.'

Ann: 'a king and queen.
In which case [UNK] had both.'

Stuart: 'Oh, it's like that is it?'

Ann: 'Mhm.'

Stuart: 'My box.'

Ann: 'Oh god.'

Shirley: 'It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter who goes first.
Who goes first if you win the toss?'

None: 'Shirley says.'

None: 'What?'

None: 'Heads or tails?'

None: 'Tails.'

Shirley: 'I can't score, I'm useless at maths.'

Ann: 'Oh bloody hell.
It's impossible, I can't do it.
And them two go together, them two go together and them two go together.
All of them go together and these two are a pair.'

Stuart: 'Well what can I say?'

Ann: 'Exactly.'

Shirley: 'I'm useless at maths.
Now don't get too many balls down too many holes at once.'

Ann: 'I'll have to take a chance won't I?'

Stuart: 'Mm well that's up to you isn't it?
Play'

Ann: 'Well I've got to somehow.

Stuart: 'You did right.
And bought it'

Ann: 'Oh yeah not right for me.'

Stuart: 'No.'

Ann: 'I'd have been better off keeping that one two.
I had two sixes, two queens one two.
Well I didn't know.'

Stuart: 'Here you are I've got your two queens and hope for your turn up or you put your one to it.
Simple as that.
The queen six and hope for turn up.
That would split, split your hand up totally.'

Ann: 'Mm that's why I was yeah.
Yes well I didn't know you see.
If I don't like playing singles, easy as doubles because you only have to put one in and it's easier.'

Stuart: 'One in yeah.'

None: 'He's not a gentleman.'

Shirley: 'I know.'

Stuart: 'I was just lucky with a turn up though.
That's all.
Just lucky with a turn up.'

Shirley: 'Come on, stop wasting time.'

None: 'I think I wouldn't [UNK]'

Stuart: 'Top one [UNK] Mm try seven.'

None: 'Oh I thought I was [UNK] then.

Terry: 'Oh it went way out.'

Terry: 'Yeah but it was [UNK] shot.

Shirley: 'Well it got there.'

Terry: 'Yeah.

Shirley: 'No.'

Terry: 'It's it's too late to ask I know.'

Ann: 'I've got to pay for a turn [UNK]'

Stuart: 'How about a six?'

Ann: 'You are.
You are, you're over a street ahead.'

Stuart: 'Not quite.
Not quite.

Ann: 'I haven't a chance in hell.
Think we'll cancel this game.'

Stuart: 'Don't give up straight away darling.
There's plenty of time to go yet.'

Ann: 'Oh I don't know.
I've no idea.
Waste of time playing.'

Stuart: 'One.
That's not very good is it?'

Ann: 'No.'

Stuart: 'Got a seven.'

Ann: 'Aye another one, go on put the third one down.
Might as well.'

Stuart: 'Yes.

Stuart: 'Oh well there you are. [UNK].'

Ann: 'That's a bit better.'

Stuart: 'Are you caught up now?'

Terry: 'No, that thirty was meant but not th not not the other one.

Grace: 'Am I in a good position?'

None: 'On your knees is better.'

Ann: 'Oh!

That was meant.'

None: 'I tell lies as well.

Ann: 'I had a two as well.'

Stuart: 'Oh dear.'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'Fifteen, two [UNK]'

Terry: 'Very very lucky but'

Stuart: 'Two for six eight ten.

Terry: 'I'm glad I I'm glad I didn't listen to you Shirley.'

None: 'Who's winning?'

Shirley: 'I didn't say, I just said it was gettable.'

Terry: 'No no, yes yes.

None: 'Who's winning?'

Stuart: 'What do you want?

Two, two four.'

Ann: 'Two six.
No two three six.

Kept jack queen three and three two.
Your box dear.'

Ann: 'Yeah and I would have got nothing.'

Stuart: 'Four.'

Ann: 'Oh yeah.'

Stuart: 'You would have had four.
Oh admittedly you would have been pig sick when a king would have, but even if the king had turned up you'd have still got the, got a run and fifteen.
Ace turned up you'd have got the run four turns up you get your runs.
Ten turns up, another jack, queen.'

Ann: 'Well I've done, didn't do it right did I?
So there, hadn't got any turned up.'

Stuart: 'Well I mean yes'

Ann: 'Didn't I?'

Stuart: 'There you go.'

Ann: 'Oh now I'm definitely not giving you nothing.'

Stuart: 'It's your box.'

Ann: 'Cos I've got a straight run through.'

Stuart: 'It's your box.'

Ann: 'Seven six five four three'

Stuart: 'It's your box!'

Ann: 'Well how, I don't bloody well know what to put in it.
I haven't the faintest idea, look three four five six seven eight.'

Stuart: 'No question.
Easy.'

Ann: 'Oh well it weren't to me cos I probably would have given you the eight [UNK]'

Stuart: 'No my, it's your box.
Try a nine.'

Ann: 'You know what I've got now anyway so it don't matter.'

Stuart: 'Oh no I would have played the nine anyway.
Twenty five. [UNK]'

Grace: 'Don't talk about it, do it.'

Stuart: 'Two four.
Six tens.
What are you up?
Are you gonna do [UNK].
Box.'

Ann: 'Two in there so'

Stuart: 'Oh you're putting [UNK].
It's no quite easy.
Then you've got the four three four five six seven eight and it's your box play the seven.
They're the same suit, they're close, they'd score.
If it'd been my box yeah it's eight three.
But your box you, you gotta keep four five six because any four any five or any six you can [UNK].'

Terry: 'Well yeah but I I'm alright now.
I'm [UNK] cos I can see balls in front of me.'

Shirley: 'Yeah, right.'

Stuart: 'So you've gotta keep your four five six and I say it's your box, seven eight has got to be the [UNK]'

Terry: 'It's very easy this.'

Stuart: 'Gotta be.'

Terry: 'Easy.
So we'll try and lead Al with that one again.
Oh sh'

Ann: 'I [UNK] give you that and it's probably a big mistake.
But I hadn't any choice.'

Stuart: 'I like you.'

Ann: 'Thank you.'

None: 'No, that's not right.'

Shirley: 'You do, you try doing what you're telling other people.'

Terry: 'What, [UNK]'

Stuart: 'Thirteen.'

Terry: 'No I'm not.

That's that's a bad shot isn't it?'

Shirley: 'But you [UNK]'

Terry: 'I know, oh sorry, yeah.'

John: '[UNK] you're well in front.'

Stuart: 'Seven.'

Terry: 'I'm well in front and I can easy just lose the hundred but I I'll try for it without trying to knock down too many skittles.'

Stuart: 'There you are, handy little turn up.

Stuart: 'About that again, it's a similar distance I would say.'

Ann: 'That's what I mean, it's not'

Stuart: 'It's as near to the [UNK] as it would have been from there [UNK] [UNK]'

Ann: 'So it's not a lot of lot of bother the only thing is that i you gotta drive in town rather than drive on country lanes to get to the main roads [UNK] little bit more dangerous as far as getting caught is concerned ha!'

Stuart: 'It's [UNK] we can always walk up the [UNK].'

Ann: 'Yep walk in the town if you're going'

Ann: 'Do you end up sort of metal box end?'

Stuart: 'No, there's metal boxes at each'

Ann: 'Well'

Stuart: 'end.'

Ann: 'Yeah I know that's what I mean, if you get walking down there you'd come to all the factories I presume.'

Stuart: 'If you come up er when you're at the Weasel Lane'

Ann: 'Mm mhm.'

Stuart: 'instead of turning up towards the Royal Standard you turn the other way, that comes down past [UNK].'

Ann: 'Mm.'

Stuart: 'Then you go right down to the bottom of [UNK] Road you cos that's a dead end anyway, [UNK].'

Ann: 'I didn't know if there was lanes going off into town, whe or oh I don't know.'

Stuart: 'Mhm.'

Ann: '[UNK] I shall have to be looking out for a second hand bike-y just for the occasional trip into town without getting Stuey out of bed so I be a bit more independent than just bothering you all time, if I just wanna pop anywhere.'

Ann: 'No I know my but it it'll give me a little independence as well will it not?'

Stuart: 'You got a shop at the top of the road ain't you?'

Ann: 'Yeah it's not far is it?'

Stuart: 'Shops at the top there.'
