Marie: 'I was thinking perhaps they'd bring them back.
So Thursday we, we usually come out of Bridge Street, go round the corner and then down to the end of the [UNK], car's parked at the end of the lane.
So I said wonder if they've got that headboard for Ken, you know I didn't know he had one [UNK] I said we'll have a look and see how much they are.
When we got there, it's all locked up.
Oh that's for stocktaking [UNK] they said.
And we looked through the side windows and there's not a thing on the ruddy counters, it's cleared out.
There's nothing there at all so there's no stock they can sell, they've shut down I expect.'

Hazel: 'Mm.'

Marie: 'And the week before it was all Christmas stuff was still in there.'

Hazel: 'Oh you know in, you know in Ponty?

Hazel: 'That's right, twenty five nil.'

Hazel: 'So Rhys says oh how did you guess but erm he come in then, he said I'm not going to the football mum.'

Marie: 'He, hmm'

Hazel: 'So I said to him well alright then I said er if you're not going to the football match you can go upstairs to your bedroom and tidy your bedroom again.
Well when I say again he hadn't touched it.
It's a mess innit Cerys?
He makes more mess in his bedroom than she does and his is because, not only is it all papers and books and toys and everything else, it's all his clothes as well.
He don't put any of his clothes away and if he's looking for anything it's all fling out of drawers and on the floor, he don't care.
And if I've hung his coats up once I've hung up, I've hung them up a hundred times, he's got a coat hanger on the back of the coat hook on the back of the door'

Marie: 'Well I gave him two when he stayed here to stay er to hang er on his door and he [UNK]'

Hazel: 'and I'm not kidding you, he's got his blue coat that he wears down the garden, you know the one with all the [UNK], he's got erm his army jacket, a grey jacket erm tt how many has he got [UNK]?
I think there's another jacket that he's got and there's no room to keep them all downstairs on the hook hanging in the passage'

Marie: 'Mm.'

Hazel: 'so I told him to keep them on the back of that door.
You put them up on the door, they're on the floor.
You pick them up again you put them back on the door, he chucks them back on the floor.'

Marie: 'Oh [UNK] Robert he used to [UNK]'

Hazel: 'Terrible!'

Marie: 'he'd go upstairs and Shirley would have put all the clean clothes back in the wardrobe and he'd go in the wardrobe oh, no I won't wear that, no I won't wear that and half the time she found the cleanest clothes were all rolled up under the bed.'

Hazel: 'Mm.'

Marie: 'Yesterday?'

Hazel: 'Mm.'

Marie: 'Tuesday we had hell of a bang.'

Hazel: 'And er erm Eileen said then she said we never had a warning then did we?

Hazel: 'Yeah it went off yesterday.
It went off about erm [UNK] half past three.'

Hazel: 'twenty five past three'

Marie: 'He probably had the telly on so perhaps I just didn't but the last time they had er a siren on it wasn't all that load I thought.
Whether it's cos the wind was blowing that way I dunno.
Did you eat those Ferrero Rocher I sent up to you?'

Hazel: 'Ooh she liked them didn't you?'

Marie: 'Oh Iris didn't.
She had a box full for Christmas, she ate three odd one, right?'

Hazel: 'Mm.'

Marie: 'She sent, they were in those little strips, she sent three in for me, she said and have you tasted these [UNK] I said I don't think so, so she sent them, I'd tasted the other ones but not those white ones so she sent three of them in for us.

Hazel: 'Yeah that's right. [UNK]'

Cerys: 'I did twelve.'

Hazel: 'Mm.'

Marie: 'But you know it surprises me I mean I know the church is, is closed and it's been closed for a couple of years now and it looks a sight because now I don't know how many members they've got, at least a couple of them could go in there and cut all the brambles down.'

Hazel: 'Mm.'

Marie: 'I mean if you belong to a church you do something to make it look tidy don't you?
I mean that church isn't in such a bad state [UNK] bloody fall on you all the time.
You go past there and you look in that front and people have been dumping bags of rubbish over there.'

Hazel: 'Yeah, they will.'

Marie: 'Little tiny white bags full with cans and odd just dump [UNK], I mean there's no respect at all lately is there?
You wouldn't think of doing it years ago'

Hazel: 'Mm.'

Marie: 'even if the church was [UNK] And they've cut all the side, the other side [UNK], Church Street they've cut all the hedge of the church down there and dumped all the grass inside, no not the grass, the branches, inside well you'd think they'd get a blooming lorry or a van to take it all down the blooming tip wouldn't you?'

Hazel: 'Mm.'

Marie: 'To ta just to make it look a bit respectable because it's a church, they're using that part of it.'

Hazel: 'Yeah.'

Marie: '[UNK] absolutely terrible.
I said to [UNK]'

Cerys: 'Nan'

Marie: 'about it the other day aye he says but they weren't supposed to cut anything down he said, they were only supposed to cut a bit off the top.
Well I said that doesn't excuse the thing of, of tipping all over and putting it inside and not shifting it.
It looks terrible.'

Cerys: 'Nan which church'

Hazel: 'Mm.'

Cerys: 'was the bit that's sticking out on the path.'

Hazel: 'Yes.'

Marie: 'No somebody could go in there who belonged to the church anyway, two or three of them and it wouldn't take long cutting all those brambles and things away.'

Cerys: 'Tt nan do you mean the Cubs' church?'

Marie: 'Yes.'

Cerys: 'Cos then they usually make fires.'

Marie: 'Well I, I don't know what's stopping some of the [UNK], they'll go up one day er there one day and they'll'

Cerys: 'Why can't they leave [UNK]'

Marie: 'throw something over it would be up.'

Cerys: 'Nan why can't they leave just a little patch of grass for the fire?'

Marie: '[UNK].
I said to Di if you want pea sticks that's the place to go because they've got [UNK] and [UNK] he said oh I go [UNK] now.
But er you'd think they'd get a lorry or something to shift it from there.'

Hazel: 'Mm.'

Marie: 'It's a fire hazard really isn't it?
You know with kids today.
And I tell you another thing I noticed, I cut through the car park in the lane behind Shirley's one day this week, I went through and [UNK] and the back door of the old police station's open.
And all the windows in the back are broken.'

Hazel: 'Mm.'

Marie: 'So I expect somebody's been and er the [UNK] er the door thing, you can get in the back way and in through the back door.
I bet there's some people sleeping in there in the night.'

Cerys: 'Someone could easily make a fire in there.'

Marie: 'I mean if they're not gonna use the building and they can't sell it, gut it.
Cos they said they were gonna sell it then they changed their mind, they were gonna pull it down [UNK]'

Cerys: 'If they can't sell it, pull it down and put something else in.'

Marie: 'It's no good [UNK] is it now?'

Cerys: 'Put something else in like a flat.'

Marie: 'Shouldn't think it's very nice inside.
There's room for flats I think.'

Cerys: 'Mm.'

Marie: 'Even on the ground floor.'

Hazel: 'There was [UNK]'

Cerys: 'Nan.

Marie: 'Well that's not a tea towel there, nanny cleaned her windows yesterday and er when I, I'd wiped er with a cleaning off [UNK] I washed it up again [UNK] and I put it out yesterday and I keep forgetting to bring it in.'

Marie: 'Ooh [UNK] there was a car out here last night Hazel and it was revving up then you hear a door go, and they weren't closing [UNK] it's bang!
Then there was voices, and then it sounded as if the boot went down and then there was the doors bang again and then it revved off and it wasn't long it came back.

Hazel: 'It was November wasn't it?'

Hazel: 'I dunno.'

Marie: 'Anyway, I put it in the paper, [UNK] phoned in the paper [UNK] and they said it'd be at least a week or fortnight before [UNK] so I didn't like but it never came out in the paper.
So I phoned them again and er they took it down and then I didn't see it in the paper again so when I phoned again and said why haven't you put it in she said well, of course, she said, if you pay two pounds she said two pound fifty'

Hazel: 'Mm.'

Marie: 'you get pr priority.
Anyway they had a, a special coupon in the Campaign this week and I said to Di I said phone this number I said and put our washing machine in, I said they're not taking no notice.
So he phoned up and he had to redial two or three times [UNK] before he started [UNK].
And then she checked [UNK] Well anyway the week after he'd phoned there was no what you call in it so he wrote it in to the damn thing and said why is it when some people puts adverts in they not only put it in once they put it in three or four times the same week'

Hazel: 'Mm.'

Marie: 'this week again there's a lot of repeats in it, and he said other people that send adverts in can't even get er a look in, they don't [UNK], anyway that, after he wrote the letter it was in the following week.
But as you know a woman come, we, she saw it in the Post Office [UNK] in the meantime and we sold it.
[UNK] phoning now [UNK] seen it in the paper we told them it was sold.
We had three calls last week not it's, it's about a month since [UNK], wanting to know about the washing machine and we said it's sold sold er a couple of weeks ago.
Anyway three people have phoned yesterday, we had two phone calls yesterday, in the morning I had one last night and there was another one this morning about the washing machine and I said sorry but I said the advert was put in the Campaign I said a month or so ago.
No she said it's in this week.
So anyway yesterday afternoon I was checking through it when the phone went again to ask about the washing machine and I was looking through the paper to see whether, and they'd put it in this week!
